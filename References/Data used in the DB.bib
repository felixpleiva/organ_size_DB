	abstract = {The present study aimed to determine the effects of adding Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to laying quail diets on performance, egg quality, and internal organ weights. We used 96 laying Japanese quail ( Coturnix coturnix Japonica ) at 12 wk of age. The birds were divided into 3 treatment groups (32 quails per group), each divided into 8 replicates (4 quails per replicate). The research was carried out in 3 periods of 28 d each. We used 3 diets; the 1st group served as a control group, receiving only a basal diet. The 2nd and 3rd experimental groups received 0.1\% (1 x 10(9) CFU/g) B. megaterium and B. amyloliquefaciens as an addition to the basal diet, respectively. Adding B. megaterium and B. amyloliquefaciens did not influence the performance parameters statistically. Also, adding B. megaterium and B. amyloliquefaciens significantly ( p {\textless} 0.05) impacted the albumen index, Haugh unit, and egg yolk compared to the control group. In contrast, the applied Bacillus species did not affect other egg quality parameter values. The addition of B. megaterium and B. amyloliquefaciens did not significantly influence body weight, heart weight, liver weight, gizzard weight, small intestine length, and cecum length among the slaughter parameters examined. Adding 0.1\% (1 x 10(9) CFU/g), of B. amyloliquefaciens to the laying quail diets can be used without causing a significant difference in performance, egg quality characteristics, and visceral weights compared to the control group.},

	abstract = {With increasing demand for improved protein-rich food, diverse poultry birds like turkey are gaining popularity in India. However, with the rising concerns of antibiotic residues and drug resistance, safe alternatives like formic acid (FA) and thymol (TH) have attracted the attention of researchers as effective replacer of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). This experiment investigated the effects of combinations of FA and TH on growth performance, immunity, gut microflora and jejunal microstructures in turkey. A total of 240 turkey poults were reared in 6 treatment groups for a period of 16 weeks with standard management and feeding: T1 (basal diet only); T2 (AGP); T3 (FA@2.5 ml + TH@240 mg/kg); T4 (FA@2.5 ml + TH@360 mg/kg); T5 (FA@7.5 ml + TH@240 mg/kg) and T6 (FA@7.5 ml + TH@360 mg/kg). The results revealed that T5 group had the highest final body weight and best FCR while the feed consumption across the groups was comparable. The immune status of the turkey improved (p p {\textless}= 0.05) in treatment groups compared to control with T4 and T5 group showcasing the best CBH response, antibody titres and relative immune organ weight index. A significant improvement (p p {\textless}= 0.05) in jejunal microstructures was observed at 16th week in T5 group over control and AGP fed group. There was significant (p p {\textless}= 0.001) reduction in total plate and coliform counts, but a positive shift was seen in Lactobacillus population in T5 group as compared to control and AGP fed group. In conclusion, the concoction of formic acid (7.5 ml/kg) + thymol (240 mg/kg) in-feed supplement improved the performance, immune status and gut health in turkey as an efficient alternative to AGPs.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e34819},
	abstract = {Salinity intrusion into the freshwater system due to climate change and anthropogenic activities is a growing global concern, which has made humans and domesticated animals more susceptible to diseases, resulting in less productivity. However, the effects of salinity on domesticated and wild birds, especially in terms of production and immunity, have not been fully elucidated yet. Therefore, this study was designed to examine the effects of salinity on the production and immunity of birds and the mechanisms by which immunity is compromised. Broiler chicks were subjected to different concentrations of salty water (control = normal water, treatment = 5 g/L, treatment = 10 g/L, and treatment = 15 g/L). The collected blood and organs from different groups of broilers were biochemically and histopathologically examined. Birds in salt-treated groups consumed significantly less feed than the control group, while the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly higher. Body weight gain was significantly lower in salt-treated groups compared to control. Serum analysis revealed a lower systemic antibody titer in the salt-treated groups compared to the control. Primary lymphoid organs (thymus and bursa of Fabricius) were reduced in size in the salt-treated group due to cellular migration and depletion from these organs. Importantly, most of the parenchyma of lymphoid organs was replaced with fibrotic tissue. Gut microbes, Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella spp., from salt-treated groups, showed less viability but developed antibiotic resistance. Levels of salinity were significantly and negatively correlated with feed intake, body weight gain, antibody titer, lymphoid organ size, and viable count of gut microbes, while FCR, fibrosis of lymphoid organs, and antibiotic resistance were significant positively correlated. In conclusion, increased salinity is a possible threat to food security and safety as it decreases body weight gain, reduces immunity, and influences the development of multi-drug resistance in gut microbes.},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Valeriana officinalis L., commonly known as “valerian”, is a traditional herbal medicine distributed in the north temperate zones of America, Europe and Asia. In traditional Chinese medicine, valerian and its roots were used for the treatment of restlessness of the heart and mind, palpitation and insomnia caused by internal depression of emotions and moods. However, safety evaluation of valerian remains deeply unclear. Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxicity, 14-days acute oral toxicity test, 90-day subchronic oral toxicity test and teratogenicity test of aqueous extract of valerian root (AEVR). Materials and methods: The genotoxicity of AEVR was evaluated with bacterial reverse mutation, mouse erythrocyte micronucleus test and in vitro mammalian cell chromosome aberration test. In the 14-days acute toxicity study, Kunming mice were administered at a dosage of 96 g/kg body weigh by gavage. In the 90-day subchronic toxicity study, Sprague-Dawley rats received oral doses of 0, 3.5, 7 and 14 g/kg body weight of AEVR. In the teratogenicity study, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received a dose of 0, 3.5, 7 and 14 g/kg body weight of AEVR. Results: AEVR did not show any genotoxicity based on the bacterial reverse mutation, mouse erythrocyte micronucleus test and in vitro mammalian cell chromosome aberration test. In the acute toxicity study, AEVR at a dose of 96 g/kg body weight did not cause death or abnormal behavior in male or female mice. In the subchronic toxicity study, at the doses of 0, 3.5, 7, 14 g/kg body weight, no dose-related effects on clinical observation, body weight, organ weight, hematology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis of AEVR were detected in male or female rats. Teratogenicity test shown that there were no significant toxicologically changes in embryonic formation, body weight of pregnant rats, external, skeletal and visceral examination observed in pregnant and fetal rats at the dosage of 0, 3.5, 7, 14 g/kg body weight. Conclusion: In vivo or in vitro assays demonstrated that AEVR does not exhibit genotoxicity. The LD50 of AEVR was greater than 96 g/kg body weight in both sex of mice according to acute oral toxicity study. Subchronic toxicity and teratogenicity tests showed that the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of AEVR was no less than 14 g/kg body weight. This study established a non-toxic dose of AEVR, providing a foundation for the use of valerian as a new resource food in some countries and regions.},

The aim of this study was to generate a reference for normal organ weights and percentage organ weights in AGMs of different age categories and sex. Methods The organ weights were compiled from 479 AGMs (285 females and 194 males) from 2004 to 2021. Age and sex differences of absolute and relative organ weights were analyzed using analysis of variance. Results The findings demonstrate that males had higher body and organ weights than age-matched females, but relative organ weights did not differ between males and females. At maturity, adrenal gland, brain, kidney, liver, thymus, and thyroid gland weights as a percentage of body weight declined, but relative weights of prostate gland, testes, and uterus were higher. Conclusion These data should be beneficial to biomedical researchers and pathologists working with AGMs.},

	doi = {10.1177/01926233241230536},
	abstract = {In nonclinical toxicology studies, lab animals are fasted typically overnight, to reduce variability in some clinical pathology parameters. However, fasting adds undue stress, and this is particularly concerning in rodents given their fast metabolic rates. Furthermore, as rodents are nocturnal animals, an overnight fasting may cause a protracted negative metabolic state even when the fasting has technically ended, given their minimal activity and food consumption during the day. Therefore, to evaluate the impacts of different fasting durations (+/- DietGel supplementation) on rats' welfare, we assessed the traditional and ancillary clinical pathology parameters in Sprague-Dawley rats, along with body weight, organ weight, and histopathology. Although most endpoints were comparable between the different fasting durations (+/- DietGel supplementation), the long fasting times ({\textgreater}= 8 hr) without DietGel supplementation caused significant decreases in body weight, liver weight, liver glycogen content, serum glucose, triglyceride, and creatinine concentrations-all findings suggestive of a negative energy balance that could impact animal welfare and consequently, data quality; while the short fasting time (4 hr) and DietGel supplementation were associated with higher triglycerides variability. Hence, we propose that short fasting time should be adequate for most toxicology studies in rats, and long fasting times should only be accommodated with scientific justification.},

	abstract = {1. Even though herbivorous fish have longer digestive tracts than carnivorous fish, a fact which agrees with optimal digestion theory, the existence of a relation between relative length of the digestive tract and capacity to digest and assimilate algal material has not been experimentally demonstrated. 2. We tested whether an increase in gut dimensions during ontogeny was associated with an increase in capability of fish to digest macroalgae in Aplodactylus punctatus. 3. Total gut length of this temperate marine fish increased from 43 to 237 cm as body length increased from 22 to 42 cm total length (TL). 4. Macroalgae, mainly fronds of the brown kelp Lessonia trabeculata, were the principal item found in their guts. 5. Individuals smaller than 30 cm had a higher proportion of invertebrate biomass in their gut than larger fish (40.6\% and 0.3\% of total content, respectively). 6. Transit time for Lessonia fronds increased as a function of body size, ranging between 20 h in fish 26.6 cm TL and 52 h in 40.0 cm fish. 7. Apparent digestibility of organic matter and total nitrogen increased as a function of body size from 38\% to 80\% when feeding on a Lessonia diet, and from 57\% to 96\% on a Ulva sp. diet. 8. These results explain why small herbivorous fish need to consume animal prey to satisfy their high mass-specific protein demands. 9. This study constitutes the first experimental demonstration in fish that an increase in relative gut length is associated with an increase in the capability to digest macroalgae. This allows larger fish to meet their energetic demands by consuming algae owing to their capability to digest low-quality food.},

	abstract = {Data on limb bone lengths from 64 mammalian species were combined with data on 114 bovid species (Scott, `79) to assess the scaling of limb lengths and proportions in mammals ranging from 0.002 to 364 kg. We analyzed log-transformed data using both reduced major axis and least-squares regression to focus on the distribution across mammals of two key traits-limb length and metatarsal/femur ratio-associated with cursorial adaptation. The total lengths of both fore and hindlimbs scale in a manner very close to the M0.33 predicted by geometric similarity. Thus the relative limb lengths of large mammals, including bovids, generally regarded among the most cursorial of mammals, are very similar to those of the rodents and insectivores in this sample. Metatarsal/femur ratio also shows little change with changing mass, although bovids tend to have relatively longer metapodials than do other families in the sample. We argue that many of the remaining morphological traits associated with cursoriality (e.g., reduction in joint mobility and number of distal limb bone elements) promote cursoriality only at large body sizes. These results lead us to question the general perception that cursoriality is most widespread among large mammals. We also suggest that discussions of cursoriality should focus explicitly on the two partially independent aspects of performance that are otherwise confounded under this general term-speed and the ability to cover substantial distance.

	abstract = {Captive Red Knots (Calidris canutus) fed soft food pellets developed atrophied stomachs, and were reluctant to eat their usual hard-shelled mollusc prey. An interspecific comparison among shorebirds showed that wild Red Knots and other intact-mollusc-eating species have gizzards with relatively great mass but very small proventriculi. Within six different shorebird species, the heavier individuals usually had the heavier stomachs as well, but in Red Knots and Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) we identified heavy premigrant individuals with reduced stomach masses, suggesting a reallocation of protein reserves before long-distance flights. In both species reduced stomach mass was associated with a relatively soft diet. We were unable to show that during adjustment of stomachs to hard-shelled prey, such prey are broken down to smaller fragments. We attribute this to the counteractive influence of the pylorus during adjustment. We summarize the suggested stomach/diet interactions as a network of causal relationships and feedback loops involving the type of diet and gizzard mass. We identify two basic modifiers of gizzard mass: one working via endurance training and disuse atrophy; and another involving endocrine and/or neural mechanisms. It is likely that, in the course of their annual cycle, shorebirds are prevented from achieving maximal digestive performance owing to seasonal changes in feeding habitats and diet enforced by their long-distance migrations.},

No significant changes were observed in the wet weights of the spleen, liver, right and left testes of the cadmium-injected birds. Nodular outgrowths, extensive hemorrhage, greyish or pallid discoloration and occasional mottling were observed on the liver of those exposed to cadmium for over 24 hours. Body weight was significantly depressed and kidney weight increased in the cadmium-treated toms.

A total of 141 individuals were analysed, with body masses ranging from 20 g (newborns) to {\textgreater}800 g (prior to first reproduction). The growth rate of the digestive tract in nursing young was rapid, and at weaning juveniles had attained 75 \% of adult large and small intestine length, but only approximately 20\% of adult body mass. At birth, muskrats contained no fat tissue, but accumulated fat reserves during the early stages of nursing. Fat reserves were then exhausted during weaning. Protein content also exhibited marked variation during the nursing-weaning period. As juveniles matured, the proportion of protein and ash became relatively constant at approximately 25 and 4.5 \% of body mass, respectively. Conversely, the proportion of fat tissue continued to increase with body mass, and was inversely related to water content. The accumulation of fat reserves from autumn through early winter was similar to that exhibited by adults and was probably associated with the presence of energy-rich food. Growth generally ceased in mid-October. Prior to the start of the reproductive season, juveniles had attained 77 \% of adult body mass and 95 \% of adult skeletal size. The growth diapause in juveniles from mid-October through March may limit their access to primary breeding habitat the following spring.},

In females the greatest organ mass reduction was in the order: ovaries, spleen, liver, adrenals, heart, gizzard whereas in the male it was spleen, testes, liver, adrenals, heart and gizzard. In the synchronous control (i. e. birds under terrestrial conditions) all examined body organ masses were decreased in females except for the gizzard. In the males the gizzard mass increased. The heart and adrenal gland mass did not differ from those of the laboratory control. The mass of other body organs decreased in the order spleen, testes and liver. These findings suggest an intensive reaction to stress during the transport to the orbital station and back to Earth. This conclusion is further supported by the data obtained in the synchronous control group.},

	doi = {10.1098/rstb.1991.0059},
	abstract = {1. The lungs of four species of bats, Phyllostomus hastatus (PH, mean body mass, 98 g), Pteropus lylei (PL, 456 g), Pteropus alecto (PA, 667 g), and Pteropus poliocephalus (PP, 928 g) were analysed by morphometric methods. These data increase fivefold the range of body masses for which bat lung data are available, and allow more representative allometric equations to be formulated for bats. 2. Lung volume ranged from 4.9 cm3 for PH to 39 cm3 for PP. The volume density of the lung parenchyma (i.e. the volume proportion of the parenchyma in the lung) ranged from 94\% in PP to 89\% in PH. Of the components of the parenchyma, the alveoli composed 89\% and the blood capillaries about 5\%. 3. The surface area of the alveoli exceeded that of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier and that of the capillary endothelium whereas the surface area of the red blood cells as well as that of the capillary endothelium was greater than that of the tissue barrier. PH had the thinnest tissue barrier (0.1204-mu-m) and PP had the thickest (0.3033-mu-m). 4. The body mass specific volume of the lung, that of the volume of pulmonary capillary blood, the surface area of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier, the diffusing capacity of the tissue barrier, and the total morphometric pulmonary diffusing capacity in PH all substantially exceeded the corresponding values of the pteropid species (i.e. PL, PA and PP). This conforms with the smaller body mass and hence higher unit mass oxygen consumption of PH, a feature reflected in the functionally superior gas exchange performance of its lungs. 5. Morphometrically, the lungs of different species of bats exhibit remarkable differences which cannot always be correlated with body mass, mode of flight and phylogeny. Conclusive explanations of these pulmonary structural disparities in different species of bats must await additional physiological and flight biomechanical studies. 6. While the slope, the scaling factor (b), of the allometric equation fitted to bat lung volume data (b = 0.82) exceeds the value for flight V(O2)max (b = 0.70), those for the surface area of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier (b = 0.74), the pulmonary capillary blood volume (b = 0.74), and the total morphometric lung diffusing capacity for oxygen (b = 0.69) all correspond closely to the V(O2)max value. 7. Allometric comparisons of the morphometric pulmonary parameters of bats, birds and non-flying mammals reveal that superiority of the bat lung over that of the non-flying mammal. However, the bat parameters relative to those of non-flying mammals deteriorate towards the higher body size range, because of the generally steeper slopes of the equations for non-flying mammals. Allometric comparisons also reveal that small-size bats have, in general, better adapted lungs than birds of equivalent size but at the higher body mass scale, bats are generally inferior to birds.},

Diets based on ground yellow corn and dehulled soybean meal were fed frm Day 1 to 3 wk of age. A total of 240 male Hubbard-by-Hubbard broilers were randomly placed in battery brooders with 10 birds per pen. Each treatment was replicated 4 times. The parameters measured included mortality, BW, feed conversion, and relative organ weight. Broilers receiving OA, the relative weights (grams of organ weight per 100 g of BW) of the liver, proventriculus, gizzard, and heart increased, while the relative weight of the bursa decreased. Supplemental Phe decreased the relative weight of the liver and increased the relative weight of the gizzard and heart. The regression slopes for Phe at 4 mg of OA per kg of diet were significantly different from 0 for BW, the relative weights of the kidney, spleen, and pancreas and approached significance for mortality (P = .065). In the absence of supplemental Phe, 42.5\% of the birds died during the study when the dose level was 4 mg of OA per kg of diet. However, when Phe was supplemented at. 8 and 2.4\%, only 12.5 and 15.0\% of the birds died, respectively. Supplementation with Phe apparently does not improve BW, but may reduce mortality in broiler chicks fed low-protein, OA-contaminated diets.},

	abstract = {Kidney volume and the volume proportions of the cortex, medulla, blood vessels larger than capillaries and ureter and ureteral ducts were investigated in 61 birds from 14 species representing passeriformes, psittaciformes, podicipediformes, anseriformes, galliformes, and columbiformes. The kidneys were fixed in situ by perfusion via their arterial supply. Kidney volume and body weight were strongly correlated (r = 0.991); the allometric function relating kidney volume (V(k)) to body weight (W) was: V(k) = 13.96 W0.902. Histological sections of one kidney from each bird were analysed by point counting with a Zeiss integrating eyepiece to estimate the volume proportions and subsequently the absolute volumes of the main components of the kidney. The avian kidney was found to consist of a very large cortex (range 71-81\%), a relatively small medulla (range 5-15\%), blood vessels larger than capillaries (range 10-13\%) and a small volume proportion of ureter and ureteral ducts (range 1-3\%). For all the birds, the mean volume proportions of the kidney components were as follows: cortex, 77\%; medulla, 10\%; blood vessels larger than capillaries, 12\%; ureter and ureteral ducts, 1\%. The values for the absolute volume of each of the main components of the kidney were well correlated with body weight. The allometric equations and correlation coefficients (r) relating: (a) the volume of cortex (V(c)) and the body weight (W) was V(c) = 10.06 W0.914, r = 0.991; (b) the volume of medulla (V(m)) and body weight was V(m) = 2.27 W0.795, r = 0.974); (c) the volume of blood vessels large than capillaries (V(b)) and body weight was V(b) = 1.76 W0.894, r = 0.988. All the birds were divided into two groups in the following five sets: (a) passeriform and non-passeriform orders; (b) galliform and non-galliform orders; (c) small and large birds weighing less than and more than 500 g respectively; (d) aquatic and non-aquatic birds; (e) desert and non-desert birds. In the two groups of each set the differences between kidney volume per gram body weight and those between the respective percentage proportions of cortex, medulla and blood vessels larger than capillaries were assessed by Student's t-test. The differences between kidney volume per gram body weight were significant for all sets except desert and non-desert birds; those between the respective percentage proportions of cortex and medulla were significant for all sets; those between the percentage proportions of blood vessels larger than capillaries were significant only in desert and non-desert birds. The quantitative structural characteristics of the avian kidney appear to be influenced by several factors since the kidney volume per gram body weight, and the volume proportions of cortex and medulla can be correlated with the order, body size and habitat. Furthermore, a relatively large medulla seems to be the adaptive advantage of species which have to mitigate scarcity of water or excessive evaporative water loss by maximum renal water conservation.},

The following traits were recorded for a sample of the fish from each year class: body circumference at the pelvic, dorsal and anal fins; area of the cross sections at the pelvic and dorsal fins; two belly thickness traits measured on each cross section; total height, height and width of each cross section; water, fat and protein percentages in the meat of the cross section at the dorsal fin; three body shape traits; and five cross section shape traits. The means and standard deviations for most traits were very similar across year-classes. The phenotypic variation was high for body weight, belly thickness, abdominal fat and percent water and fat in the meat. The variation was also substantial for meat colour score, condition factor and for most of the shape traits. Except for gonad weight, gonad index and viscera weight, sex effects accounted for a small proportion of the total variance, but were significant for most traits and should be taken into account in making a model. The few significant sex-by-year-class interaction effects were negligible. As high selection intensity can be practised in this species, the possibilites for genetic improvement of most of the examined traits are very good, on the assumption that the traits also show genetic variation.},

A significantly greater proportion of growth plates of the tarsometatarsus was closed in the control as compared to the lame turkeys. Pancreas weight relative to BW was significantly greater for lame as compared to control turkeys. Plasma insulin was undetectable in both fasted lame and control turkeys. When feed was returned to the turkeys, plasma insulin concentrations were significantly lower in lame compared to control turkeys. The return of feed had no effect on plasma glucagon levels in controls, but concentrations were decreased significantly in lame birds.

Kidney mass, number of glomeruli, and number of medullary cones all tended to increase with body mass. Smaller birds, with smaller kidneys, had smaller nephrons with smaller glomeruli. Lengths of medullary cones tended to increase with body mass and were exceptionally long in the macaroni penguin. The proportion of nephrons that were mammalian-type (MT, with loops of Henle) ranged from 7\% (ring-necked pheasant) to 30\% (zebra finch, glaucous-winged gull) and was unrelated to kidney mass. The percent of kidney mass comprised of medullary cones varied from 5 to 13\%, unrelated to kidney mass. The number of reptilian-type (without loops of Henle) nephrons associated with each medullary cone tended to increase with kidney mass. Of the variables examined, length of the medullary cones, and hence of the longest loops of Henle, was most strongly correlated with urinary concentrating ability; however, this correlation was negative. Concentrating ability was also strongly negatively correlated with body mass (small birds concentrate better). No significant relation existed between concentrating ability and proportion of MT nephrons. Our data suggest that, in a broad interspecific comparison, the quantitative extent of the renal medulla is not the primary determinant of urinary concentrating ability in birds.},

	abstract = {The weights of harp seal pups quadruple during 13 days of suckling while hooded seal pups double in weight in a lactation period of just 4 days. Pups of both species then fast for a month or longer. As a first measure of tissue responses to this `'feast and famine” pattern, we weighed the body, sculp (blubber and attached skin), core (carcass including viscera) and major internal organs of seal pups at birth, at the end of suckling, and at the end of the fast. When expressed as a percentage of body weight, the weights of the internal organs of newborn harp and hooded seals were within the range reported for newborn land mammals. During suckling, harp and hooded seals gained 2.3 and 6.5 kg/day body weight, respectively, but a large part (64-73\%) of this gain was blubber and skin rather than core. Even though pups were ingesting great quantities of fat, their digestive organs (stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas) were neither particularly large at birth nor did these organs gain in weight or length unusually rapidly. Most organs increased in weight in proportion to the increase in core weight, but the liver and spleen increased proportionately more than the core, and the stomach, heart and kidneys increased proportionately less. At the end of suckling, sculp accounted for more than half of the body weight in both species. The subsequent 4-week fast resulted in weight loss from both the sculp and core, and the liver and spleen decreased in weight by about 70\%. The net effect of sequential suckling and fasting was particularly striking in the hooded seal pup, which had a lighter core, heart, liver and spleen at 1 month postpartum than at birth. These data illustrate a remarkable cycle of nutrient deposition and depletion which is undoubtedly central to the survival of young seals in the harsh pack-ice environment.},

Five semipurified isocaloric diets (390 kcal/100 g dry ingredients) containing 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 mg protein/kcal ME were prepared with the without 2.0 mg MT/kg of diet and fed to 5-g rainbow trout for 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, fish were weighed and measured, and then dissected or cooked to obtain individual wet weights of the head, fins, skin, muscle, carcass bone, viscera, and rib section. Steroid treatment increased the weight gain of muscle tissue in direct proportion to the increase in body weight gain. Linear bone growth was enhanced with treatment, but the rate of increase did not keep pace with the rate of weight increase of the rest of the body. This accounted for a lowered percentage bone weight gain and increased K (100 .cntdot. [fish weight, g]/[total length, cm]3) of MT-treated fish. Dietary P:ME ratio had little effect on K of the fish.},

Allometrical analysis of brain-body weight relationships indicates that Cetorhinus maximus shows by far the lowest degree of cerebralization of any shark investigated to date, possibly reflecting its plankton-feeding mode of life. Furthermore, some external morphological features of the brain appear to be species-specific. The proportions of brain parts indicates a primitive vertebrate brain organization. The size of the telecephalon, 34\% of the total brain, equals that in some other sharks, whereas the cerebellum, 30\% of the total brain in the basking shark, is significantly larger than in any other shark investigated. Furthermore, C. maximus shows some peculiarities concerning the nuclear expansion in the telencephalon. A rather large caudal interhemispheric region is especially striking. The relation of brain volume to brain cavity volume is approximately 1:16.},

Islet tissue mass was assessed using a linear scanning technique on sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and was compared with body weight. Specific cell types were assessed using a point-intercept method, on aldehyde-fuchsin-stained sections for beta (.beta.) cells, and on immunoperoxidase sections for alpha cells (glucagon) and delta cells (somatostatin). Positive regional differences noted were a greater proportion of islet tissue in the tail region, and a lower proportion of .alpha. cells in the head region. Alpha cells were peripherally situated in the islets. These results show some elements of agreement with a previously proposed hypothesis regarding the general patterns of arrangement of the mammalian endocrine pancreas.},

	abstract = {The field vole, Microtus montanus, was used as a model system to evaluate the chronic effects of infection by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense on hepatic mixed-function oxidase activity. At day 28 post inoculation there was a 97\% increase in liver wet weight per g body weight. A portion of the increase (21\%) was accounted for by tissue edema which occurred after day 14 of infection. Total hepatic cytochrome P-450 content and related total tissue mixed-function oxidase activities were decreased to about 60\% of control levels at day 28 post inoculation. The decrease in total tissue mixed-function oxidase activity was partly due to a small decrease in microsomal protein per cell, and partly to a large decrease in cytochrome P-450 concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum. Although the decrease in total liver monooxygenase activity in several substrates roughly paralleled the loss in cytochrome P-450 content, several other microsomal enzyme markers not related to cytochrome P-450 monooxygenation were elevated in proportion to total liver microsomal protein content. The results suggest that in M. montanus during trypanosomiasis, there is proliferation of hepatic cells with normal content of endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, there appears to be selective toxicity for hepatic cytochrome P-450 and related monooxygenase activities. This may compromise the animals' ability to metabolize and dispose of other drugs to which the animal may be exposed in the course of infection. © 1982.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the analysis of over 15,000 weights of Mallard caught for ringing at Borough Fen Decoy, Northamptonshire, during a 13 year period. Weights are corrected to give condition indices by using wing length to give an indication of body size. The weight of pectoral muscles varies with body weight but as the fat stores increase in weight the proportion of body weight made up of flight muscles decreases. Body weight corrected for size gives a better indication of the bird's condition (defined as its fitness for its present and future needs) than the relative weight of the pectoral muscles or the shape of the breast. The relationships between food availability and weather, and condition are examined. Only occasionally can a drop in condition following hard weather be detected; the birds normally emigrate to the coast after a few days of adverse conditions. There is a relationship between the condition of Mallard in autumn and the amount of grain left on their stubble feeding grounds after harvest. The implications of variations in winter condition on survival and breeding success are briefly discussed. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Maternal hypophysectomy was performed between 58-71 days of gestation. Fetal hypophysectomy was performed between 114-117 days of pregnancy. Gravimetric data on body and organ weights were compiled on term infants. Completeness of hypophysectomy was confirmed by histological examination of the sella turcica from each operated animal. Morphological and quantitative studies were performed on serially sectioned ovaries of term infants. Maternal, but not fetal, hypophysectomy produced a generalized fetal growth retardation. Term infant mean adrenal, but not thyroid weight was elevated significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) following maternal hypophysectomy. Conversely, mean ovarian, adrenal and thyroid weights were markedly reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) in term infants following fetal hypophysectomy. Maternal hypophysectomy had no adverse effects on the morphology of term infant ovaries. In contrast, within ovaries of infants following ablation of the fetal hypophysis, the course of oogenesis was disordered and oocytes had undergone atresia. Fetal hypophysectomy resulted in a reduction in total numbers of germ cells and a significant increase in the percentage of germ cells undergoing atresia. Although the total numbers of germ cells in ovaries of term infants in the absence of the maternal hypophysis was half that in intact controls, the percentage of atretic germ cells was similar to the controls. A dynamic interaction of fetal and maternal hypothalamic-pituitary axes governs the development of the fetus and its endocrine organs. Survival of gametes within the fetal ovaries of these primates is dependent primarily on secretions of the fetal pituitary.},

	abstract = {Comparisons of the effects of thiouracil treatment, surgical thyroidectomy, and radiothyroidectomy on body and organ weights of White Leghorn chicks were made to determine the most effective method of producing hypothyroidism. Radiothyroidectomy was deemed most effective and in a 2nd experiment radiothyroidectomy, castration, and replacement of thyroid hormone and/or androgen were utilized in setting up the following groups of male chicks (1) Control, (2) Castrates, (3) Thyro-idectomized, (4) Thyroidectomized castrates, (5) both procedures plus partial thyroid hormone replacement, (6) both procedures plus exogenous methyl testosterone, (7) both procedures plus androgen and thyroid. Castration was done when the birds were about 1-week-old. Radiothyroidectomies were done on Day 11. Hormones were mixed with feed. Comb size and body weight were measured weekly, and daily food consumption was measured throughout. The experiment was terminated when the birds were 5 weeks old, and the following conclusions were drawn from the measurements made: (1) Castration had no effect on body weight in the presence or absence of thyroid hormone, whereas thyroid lack decidedly reduced body weight gain. (2) Exogenous androgen reduced food intake and body growth in Group 6, but not when endogenous or exogenous thyroid was present. (3) Both androgen and thyroid hormone are involved in comb growth, but either alone resulted in more growth than occurred in the thyroidectomized castrates. (4) Some androgen is produced by the significantly smaller testes of the thyroidectomized chick. (5) Lack of thyroid hormone (Groups 3, 4, and 6) resulted in larger relative liver weights and greatly increased liver glycogen. (6) Subnormal exogenous thyroid hormone (Group 5) gave less than normal body and comb growth, but allowed normal liver size and glycogen content to be maintained. (7) Thyroid weight was significantly reduced by castration. (8) The highest comb water content was in those groups having both thyroid and androgen. (9) Adrenal weight was unaffected by any of the treatments.},

	abstract = {Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica) is a freshwater percichthyid endemic to south-eastern Australia. In view of its conservation status (indeterminate), and its importance as a sport fish, natural stocks are replenished through a breeding programme using mature stock taken from the wild each year. This paper is the first of a series of investigations instigated to understand the underlying causes of the lack of response of Macquarie perch, caught from the wild and spawned and then tankreared for a year, to hypophysation techniques. In this paper, results of physical characteristics, proximate composition and ovarian histology of wild-caught and tank-reared fish (injected with salmon GnRHa and non-injected) are presented. Oocyte diameter distribution patterns indicate that Macquarie perch spawn once each year, and that in tank-reared fish oocyte maturation is incomplete with only a small proportion of oocytes reaching maturation. The mean (sd) gonadosomatic and hepatosomatic indices of wild fish were 11.25 (2.38) and 0.59 (0.10) and that of tank-reared fish were 4.84 (0.70) and 1.44 (0.09) respectively. These two parameters differed significantly (p{\textless}0.05) in the two groups of fish. Major differences also existed in the proximate composition of the liver and the way the liver components responded to GnRHa injection. The percent (sd) protein, lipid and ash by dry weight in the liver of wild injected fish were 57.02 (0.66), 30.63 (1.22) and 8.24 (0.05) respectively while in the liver of tank-reared uninjected fish these values were 30.87 (1.36), 24.59 (1.18) and 6.43 (0.13) respectively. When expressed as an absolute amount or an amount kg-1 body weight, all of moisture, protein, lipid, ash and nitrogen free extract were greater in tank-reared than wild fish. No significant differences were observed between wild and tank-reared fish in the composition of the body musculature or the oocytes. © 1995 Chapman \& Hall.},

The importance of linoleic acid (18:2n-6) itself and of dietary y-linolenic acid (18:3n-6) as essential fatty acids (EFA) in Japanese quail were investigated with regard to liver lipid metabolism. Experimental diets were made by adding of 0, 2 or 4 g y-linolenic acid/kg, or 20 g linoleic acid/kg to an n-6 EFA-free diet. From 3 to 6 weeks of age, birds were fed equal amounts of experimental diets. 2. Liver weight and lipid content in birds fed the 2 and 4 g y-linolenic acid/kg diet were significantly lower than those in birds fed the y-linolenic acid-free diet. However, no significant difference was observed between the y-linolenic acid- and linoleic acid-supplemented diets. 3. In birds fed the 4 g y-linolenic acid/kg diet, the proportion of arachidonic acid in the liver lipid was similar to that in quail fed the 20 g linoleic acid/kg diet, implying a conversion rate from linoleic acid to y-linolenic acid of approximately 20\% of whole body content. 4. It is concluded that linoleic acid itself is not essential for Japanese quail and that at least 2 g/kg of y-linolenic acid in the diet completely prevents liver enlargement accompanied by lipid accumulation. © 1995, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.

	abstract = {Background: Investigations of reproductive endocrinology of flying foxes (genus Pteropus) have been hampered by inadequate information on the normal morphology of the megachiropteran pituitary. Methods: The novel technique of graphical three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction, supported by more traditional anatomical techniques, have now been used to examine the shapes of, the interrelations between, the lobes of the pituitary of the little red flying fox, Pteropus scapulatus. Statistical analysis of data from three species tested whether there were changes in pituitary size with annual cycles in function, particularly with key stages of reproduction. Results: In the three species of Australian flying foxes examined, the hypophyseal cleft is closed; the pars intermedia extends over the rostral, ventral, and lateral surfaces of the neural lobe, The pars distalis is broad rostrally and extends over two-thirds of the lateral and ventral pars intermedia. The hypophyseal recess is broad at the median eminence, then narrows and extends through the infundibulum to, but not into, the neural lobe, In adult animals the pituitary weight was 10.0 +/- 0.3 mg (mean +/- s.e.) in P. scapulatus, 14.7 +/- 0.5 mg in Pteropus poliocephalus (greyheaded flying foxes), and 18.7 +/- 1.5 mg in Pteropus alecto (black flying foxes). Pituitary weight was not significantly affected by reproductive stage. Conclusions: Thus histologically, the adenohypophysis and neurohypophysis are similar to those of other mammals. Comparative differences in pituitary size reflected differences in species body size rather than cyclical reproduction. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {The masses of the locomotor and cardiac muscles of wild barnacle goose goslings, from a migratory population, were examined systematically during development and their values compared to those of pre-migratory geese. Pre-flight development was typified by approximately linear increases of body, leg, and heart ventricular mass with respect to age. Flight muscle showed an exponential increase in mass. Pectoralis muscle mass was 14.2 +/- 0.3\% of body mass (1297 +/- 738, n=7) in early flying goslings compared to 16.6 +/- 0.3\% of body mass (2318 +/- 109 g, n = 8) in pre-migratory geese. Post-flight development was typified by stasis of leg muscle mass but hypertrophy of ventricular and pectoralis muscle mass in proportion to body mass. Ventricular mass relative to body mass showed the lowest values at 5 weeks of age (0.62 +/- 0.01\%) with peak values at 1 week of age (1.04 +/- 0.04\%). The latter may be associated with both the requirements of thermoregulation in these precocial, arctic breeding geese and the need to forage approximately 24 hours post-hatch. Peak Values for leg muscle mass, relative to body mass, were found at 3 weeks of age (12.7 +/- 0.36\%), with lowest values in the pre-migratory geese (6.7 +/- 0.21\%), while peak values for pectoralis muscle mass were expressed in the premigratory geese with lowest values at 1 week of age (0.94 +/- 0.07\%). Ventricular mass was proportional to leg muscle mass up to 5 weeks of age (M(v) = 0.38 M(t)(0.68), r(2) = 0.95), but subsequent increase in ventricular mass was proportional to pectoralis muscle mass (M(v) = 0.25M(p)(0.73), r(2) = 0.81).},

	abstract = {Perinatal exposure of rodents to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been shown to result in thymic atrophy and cell-mediated immune suppression at lower doses than are required to produce those effects following adult exposure. This study was designed to examine the effects that in utero TCDD exposure has on thymocyte development in the rat. Timed-bred pregnant F344 rats were given 0, 1.0, or 3.0 mu g TCDD/kg body weight by gavage on gestational day 14 (GD14). On GD19 or GD22/postnatal day one (PD1), the dams were euthanized, and the dams and their offspring were examined for organ weight and thymus phenotypic alterations. GD19 fetuses from the 3.0 mu g TCDD/kg maternal exposure group exhibited decreases in relative thymus weight and thymic cellularity. There were a decreased percentage of CD3(-)/CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and an increased percentage of CD3(-)/CD4-CD8+ thymocytes in these fetuses, but there were no alterations in the CD3(+) subsets. No effects were seen in the GD19 fetuses from the 1.0 mu g TCDD/kg dosage group. In the TCDD-exposed GD22/PD1 offspring thymic atrophy was no longer present, but there was an increase in the relative liver weight. In addition, there were decreased percentages of CD3(-)/CD4(-)CD8(-), CD3(+)/CD4(-)CD8(-), and CD3(+)/CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and an increased percentage of CD3(+)/CD4(-)CD8(+) thymocytes. The CD3(+)/CD4(-)CD8(-) and CD3(+)/CD4(-)CD8(+) cell populations were the most sensitive, with changes appearing at both 1.0 and 3.0 mu g TCDD/kg maternal exposures. The TCDD-exposed GD19 dams exhibited an increased relative liver weight, a decreased relative thymus weight, and alterations in thymic CD3(+) populations. Three days later the relative organ weights had recovered in the dams, but the phenotypic alterations were seen in CD3(-) as well as CD3(+) thymocyte subsets. These results indicate that the developing rat fetal thymus is susceptible to the effects of TCDD. In addition, pregnant rats and their offspring showed similar alterations in thymocytic phenotypes.

	abstract = {In endothermic vertebrates, long-term increases in metabolic energy demand are often associated with increases in food intake and accompanied by increases in organ mass,Wilde-scale increases in organ mass have often been attributed to a metabolic response to increased energy intake and utilization. On a constant diet, however, increased food intake is also associated with increased protein intake. We hypothesized that, while increased food intake itself may be responsible for increases in digestive tract mass, the consequent increased protein intake would be the factor responsible for increased kidney mass and function. Thus, we exposed male and female mice to diets differing in protein level (7 \%, 15 \% or 46 \% casein by mass) at different acclimation temperatures (5 degrees C or 23 degrees C), Within an acclimation temperature, food intake rate remained constant over the entire range of dietary protein level, and protein intake rate increased as dietary content increased. The mice in the cold-acclimation group increased food intake rate by 48-120 \% over those in the warm-acclimation group. Liver, kidney and stomach mass increased with protein intake rate, while digestive tract and other vital organ masses increased only in response to increased energy intake rate, Blood urea nitrogen levels increased with protein intake rate. Glomerular filtration rates increased with increases in dietary protein level in male mice but not female mice. Finally nitrogen filtration rate increased with protein intake rate for mice on the high-protein diet.We suggest that it is primarily the increased protein intake rate rather than the increased food intake rate that results in the changes in kidney and liver mass and kidney function observed to occur in situations of high energy demand.},

The breeding base consisted of 35 full sib families of the Lake Manzala strain, Egypt. On the basis of a standard testing procedure maturation status was determined by slaughtering 80 individuals (half of each family) at an age of 136 days. Gonad weight, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the visual classification of the gonadal development were used as indicators for the maturation process. Family selection was carded out separately for each sex, using GSI for males and a visual assessment of gonadal development for females as selection trait. Only families with a minimum weight equal to or above the average family means were considered for selection to avoid the selection of families with high proportion of underdeveloped offspring which have retarded or insignificant gonadal development. For establishing the next generation in the selected line, matings were restricted to combinations of female spawners derived from selected 'female' families with males derived from the selected 'male' families but avoiding full-sib matings. To keep the generation interval as short as possible and to ensure a condensed breeding period, the heaviest fish within each selected families were used as spawners for the next generation (ca. 25\% heaviest fish for males and the 50\% heaviest fish for females). A random sample of two males and four females per family and generation was chosen as spawners for the control line. The number of families evaluated varied from 25 to 31 for the selection and control line in the first and from 30 and 32 in the second generation, respectively. After two generations significant responses of -1.25 standard deviations were realized both for GSI in males and for the maturity stage of gonads in females. Additionally, males of the selected line had significantly lower gonad weights than control males indicating a lower stage of maturity. Females of the selected line had significantly lower GSI values and a tendency for lower gonad weights than control females. Body weights did not differ significantly between the selected and control lines.},

Absolute and relative size of organs from 30 male seals are presented, with histological examination conducted on 7 animals. The relationship between log body weight, log organ weight and age was investigated using linear regression. Twenty five animals were of known age, while 6 were aged from counts of incremental lines observed in the dentine of tooth sections. For the range of ages represented in this study, body weight changes were accurately described by the exponential growth equation, weight = w(o)r(c), with body weight increasing by 23 \% per annum until at least 9-10 y of age. Organ weight increased at a rate of between 25 \% and 33 \% per annum until at least 9-10 y of age, with the exception of the intestines, where exponential increase appeared to have ceased by about 7 y. The relationship between body weight and organ weight was investigated using logarithmic transformations of the allometric equation, y = ax(b), where the exponent b is 1 if organ weight is proportional to body weight. Most organs increased in proportion to the body. However, the heart, liver and spleen had exponents b {\textgreater} 1, suggesting that these organs increased at a faster rate than the body. The basic anatomical features of the viscera were similar to those of other pinnipeds, with some exceptions, including the arrangement of the multilobed lung and liver. Apart from the large liver and kidneys, relative size of the organs did not differ greatly from similar sized terrestrial carnivores. The histological features of the organs were generally consistent with those previously described for this species and other otariids. The heart, as in other pinnipeds, was unlike that of cetacea in not having unusually thick endocardium or prominent Purkinje cells. Notable histological features of the lungs included prominent fibrous septa, prominent smooth muscle bundles, cartilage extending to the level of the alveolar sacs and ample lymphoid tissue. The spleen had a thick capsule, well developed trabeculae and plentiful plasma cells. Abundant parietal cells were present in the fundic glands and lymphoid follicles were present in the gastric lamina propria, particularly in the pyloric region. Small intestinal villi were very long but this could have resulted from underlying chronic inflammation. Lymphoid follicles were prominent in the colon. The kidney reniculi each had a complete cortex, medulla and calyx, but a sportaperi medullaris musculosa was not identified.},

	abstract = {Body proportions and tissue composition (e.g., relative contributions of muscle, skin, bone, and adipose to total body mass) were determined through dissection of four adult captive lowland gorillas. The relative contribution of bone varies little among the four animals (10.2-13.4\%) despite considerable range in body weights (99.5-211 kg). In tissue composition, three animals have on average 37.3\% muscle relative to body mass. Maximum estimates of body fat range between 19.4-44\%. Differences in age, sex, and life history events partially explain the observed variation in body proportions and tissue composition among the four animals. Although gorillas are considered extremely sexually dimorphic in body weight and canine size, differences in tissue are not as dramatic as body mass differences suggest. This study found sex differences mostly in the upper body; males have relatively heavier forelimbs, including heavier deltoid, trunk-binding, and deep back muscles compared to the younger female. The old, obese female had one half the muscle tissue of the other three animals (16\% vs. 37.3\%), and twice the body fat (44\%); forelimbs and upper body musculature were relatively well-developed to compensate for the restricted hip-joint movement due to arthritis. Data on the variation in tissue composition and body proportions in gorillas provide a basis for comparison with other hominoids, including humans. For example, compared to highly dimorphic orangutans, gorillas have more muscle, less adipose tissue, lighter forelimbs and heavier hindlimbs. Such analyses complement studies of the skeleton and contribute to our understanding of human evolution and adaptation. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {We analysed the nutritional status of 44 oiled rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) found dead along the Japan Sea coast. The species is a medium-sized Alcidae and one of the most vulnerable diving seabirds to oil spills in the northern North Pacific. We compared results with those obtained from 19 non-oiled auklets incidentally killed in fishing nets or predated at colonies as controls. All of the oiled birds were mal-nourished, having lost 60\% of liver mass and 1/3rd each of their body, muscle and organ (e.g., uropygial gland) masses. They consumed 90\% of their subcutaneous and abdominal fat and more than half of fats stored in muscles and other organs, thus having only 7 g total fat remaining. Bone marrow was almost entirely replaced with water. There were no stomach contents and livers were light, having lost nearly two thirds of mass. Lon values for nutritional indices in the oiled group, compared with those of the non-oiled group, showed that oiled birds did not die instantly but died of nutritional exhaustion. A bird weighing 620 g on average was estimated to starve to death in one to two days after oiling, as oiled aquatic birds consume energy rapidly due to loss of thermoregulatory ability as a result of plumage oiling. As body mass is highly correlated both with organ mass and fat storage, as shown in detail in this study, body mass is effective as a simple and important index to evaluate nutritional recovery for use in determining the best time to return birds to sea after care in rehabilitation facilities. Based on our nutritional study, we recommend making every effort to rescue birds on the day they are oiled if rescue and rehabilitation are going to occur, as oiled birds quickly starve to death while at sea? especially during the cold winter.

While body mass, BMR and body composition was stable during the incubation period, both body mass and BMR decreased significantly during the chick-rearing period. Both whole-body and mass-specific BMR decreased during this period indicating that the reduction in BMR must be due to an altered metabolic intensity. Body composition analyses revealed that while most organs masses changed in parallel to total body mass, the liver showed a disproportional decrease. In a subsample of individuals, a significant relationship was also found between liver mass and BMR. The results suggest that BMR is not a species-specific character, but rather a flexible physiological parameter. with liver mass being an important determinator.},

Three mixed-sex groups, each containing 6 birds, ate duck pellets containing 0, 50, or 300 mug Cd/g, respectively, for 4 1/2 mo and drank 300 mM NaCl. Only females on the high-Cd diet lost body mass. Ingestion of Cd reduced heart mass in females. There was increased mass of Harderian and salt glands in both sexes. Mass of kidneys and liver increased only in males, and the gut mass (also length) increased more in males. Cadmium ingestion also induced (1) inflammation of renal interstitium and degenerative tubular changes, (2) marked degenerative changes in testes, (3) increased heart water content, (4) decreased cytoplasmic volume of liver cells, (5) reduced proportion of basophilic granular cells in chromaffin tissue of the adrenal glands, and (6) in the ileum, increased heterophilia in the lamina propria and, only in females, the apoptosis to mitosis ratio in crypt cells of the epithelium. The ducks' outward appearance gave no indication that ingesting large amounts of cadmium for 4 1/2 mo produced deleterious effects, but the physiological consequences were profound. Both sexes had greatly reduced gonadal mass and the males produced no sperm. The higher dietary level greatly hypertrophied the liver, kidneys, and gut only in males. The cadmium-induced changes in organs, particularly in the gonads, kidneys, and adrenal glands, should greatly impair the health and reproductive capacity of these ducks.},

Two experiments were carried out to determine the effect of inclusion of raw (kabuli and desi) and autoclaved (desi) chickpea seeds in wheat-based starter diets in chickens grown to 28 d of age on the performance, digestive organ sizes, nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy (AME(n)), ileal apparent protein and starch digestibilities (APD and ASD) and intestinal alpha -amylase and trypsin activities. 2. In the first experiment, diets were formulated to contain 0, 150, 300 and 450 g/kg of raw kabuli chickpea seeds. Increasing the proportion of seed in the diet negatively influenced body weight gain, food intake and food efficiency. The relative weights of the pancreas, liver and gizzard and the relative lengths of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and caeca were increased significantly when the chickpea seeds were included in the diets. Correspondingly, APD, ASD, alpha -amylase and trypsin activities and AME(n) were reduced significantly when the chickpea seed was incorporated in the diets. 3. In the 2nd experiment, diets were formulated to contain 75 and 150 g/kg of raw and autoclaved desi chickpea seeds. Weight gain and food intake of the chicks given desi chickpea diets were significantly reduced compared with those fed on the control diet. Increasing the proportion of seed in the diet negatively influenced body weight gain, food intake and food efficiency. Moreover, a significant increment in the relative weights of liver and pancreas, and in the relative lengths of duodenum, ileum and caeca was observed when the concentration of chickpea seeds in the diets was increased. Feeding autoclaved seeds significantly increased the weight gains and the food intakes. However, food efficiency was not modified by the autoclaving. Relative weights of gizzard and liver and relative lengths of ileum were decreased significantly by the inclusion of autoclaved desi chickpea in the diet. 4. We concluded that the inclusion of kabuli (up to 450 g/kg) and desi (up to 150 g/kg) chickpea seeds produced a negative effect on the performance of the birds, and an increment in the relative weights and lengths of the digestive organs. In addition, the incorporation of kabuli chickpea produced a reduction of protein and starch digestibilities, alpha -amylase and trypsin activities, and AME(n) of food compared with the birds given the control diet.

High-food-intake mice had significantly greater body masses and a significantly elevated RMR compared with the low-intake mice. Data pooled across strains indicated that body mass, sex and strain together explained over 56\% of the observed variation in RMR. The effects of strain and sex on RMR and tissue morphology were removed, and three separate statistical analyses to investigate the relationship between RMR and organ morphology were performed: (i) employing individual regression analysis with each tissue component as a separate predictor against RMR; (ii) individual regression analysis with residual organ mass against residual RMR (i.e. with strain, sex and body mass effects removed); and (iii) pooling of some organ masses into functional groupings to reduce the number of predictors. Liver mass was the most significant morphological trait linked to differences in RMR. Small intestine length was significantly greater in the high-intake line; however, no difference was observed between strains in the dry mass of this organ, and there was no evidence to associate variability in the mass of the alimentary tract with variability in RMR. The effects of strain on RMR independent of the effect on body mass were consistent with the anticipated effect from the strain differences in the size of the liver.},

Significant organ weight increases were seen in the liver, lungs, and spleen of both species and the kidneys of rats, mainly in groups treated with 250 mg/kg/day and above. Hematological analysis indicated increases for both species in the white blood cell and lymphocyte counts. Sites of toxicity identified histopathologically were the rectum, liver, mesenteric and mandibular lymph nodes (both sexes), spleen (mice only), and lungs and kidneys (rats only). Lesions consisted mainly of infiltration into multiple tissues of vacuolated histiocytes, which, by histochemical investigation, indicated the presence of neutral and acidic mucins and lipidic material within the vacuoles. Transmission electron microscopy identified these vacuoles as lysosomal structures that exhibited a variety of contents. On the basis of our findings, we propose that Elmiron was absorbed through the focally disrupted rectal mucosa, was deposited in the lamina propria, accumulated within macrophages, and then was distributed by these cells or as a free chemical via the lymphatics and blood, to the various organ sites manifesting histiocytic infiltration. The cytoplasmic membrane-bound structures within macrophages were lysosomes containing membranous material of cellular origin and, perhaps, remnants of the deposited test material, Elmiron.},

	volume = {205},

	abstract = {The potential for thermal acclimation in marsupials is controversial. Initial studies suggest that the thermoregulatory maximum metabolic rate (MMR) in metatherians; cannot be changed by thermal acclimation. Nevertheless, recent studies reported conspicuous seasonality in both MMR and in basal metabolic rate (BMR). We studied the role of thermal acclimation in the Chilean mouse-opossum, Thylamys elegans, by measuring MMR and BMR before and after acclimation to cold or warm conditions. Following acclimation we also measured the mass of metabolically active organs, and the activity of a key digestive enzyme, aminopeptidase-N. No significant effect of thermal acclimation (i.e. between cold- and warm-acclimated animals) was observed for body mass, MMR, body temperature or factorial aerobic scope. However, the BMR of cold-acclimated animals was 30\% higher than for warm-acclimated individuals. For organ mass, acclimation had a significant effect on the dry mass of caecum, liver and kidneys only. Stepwise multiple regression using pooled data showed that 71\% of the variation in BMR is explained by the digestive organs. Overall, these results suggest that MMR is a rather rigid variable, while BMR shows plasticity. It seems that T. elegans cannot respond to thermal acclimation by adjusting its processes of energy expenditure (i.e. thermogenic capacity and mass of metabolically active organs). The lack of any significant difference in aminopeptidase-N specific activity between warm- and cold-acclimated animals suggests that this response is mainly quantitative (i.e. cell proliferation) rather than qualitative (i.e. differential enzyme expression). Finally, as far as we know, this study is the first to report the effects of thermal acclimation on energy metabolism, organ mass and digestive enzyme activity in a marsupial.},

	abstract = {We examined the mechanistic basis for two whole-animal performance traits, aerobic capacity and burst speed, in six laboratory-reared Trinidadian guppy populations from different native drainages with contrasting levels of predation. Using within- and between-population variation, we tested whether variation in organs and organ systems (heart, gill and swimming motor mass) and the activities of several enzymes that support locomotion (citrate synthetase, lactate dehydrogenase and myofibrillar ATPase) are correlated with aerobic performance (maximum rates of oxygen consumption, V(O2)max) or burst performance (maximum swim speed during escape responses). We also tested for associations between physiological traits and habitat type (different drainages and predation levels). Organ size and enzyme activities showed substantial size-independent variation, and both performance measures were strongly correlated to body size. After accounting for size effects, neither burst nor aerobic performance was strongly correlated to any organ size or enzymatic variable, or to each other. Two principal components (PCI, PC2) in both males and females accounted for most of the variance in the organ size and enzymatic variables. In both sexes, heart and gill mass tended to covary and were negatively associated with citrate synthetase and lactate dehydrogenase activity. In males (but not females), variation in aerobic performance was weakly but significantly correlated to variation in PCI, suggesting that heart and gill mass scale positively with V-O2max. Neither of the component variables and no single morphological or enzymatic trait was correlated to burst speed in either sex. Evolutionary changes in important life history traits occur rapidly in guppy populations subjected to different predation intensities (high mortality in downstream sites inhabited by large predatory fish; low mortality in upstream sites lacking large predators). We found significant differences between stream drainages in all morphological variables and most enzymatic variables, but only the mass of the swimming motor and LDH activity were significantly affected by predation regime. Overall, our data show that microevolution has occurred in the physiological foundations of locomotor performance in guppies, but evolutionary changes in physiology do not closely correspond to the predation-induced changes in life history parameters.},

We studied the nitrogen requirements of hummingbirds as well as how they use small arthropods to satisfy their nitrogen and energy requirements and how organ mass varies with nitrogen intake. Non-reproductive green-backed firecrowns Sephanoides sephaniodes were maintained for 10 days on diets containing 0\%, 0.96\%, 1.82\%, 4.11\% and 11.1\% nitrogen (dry-matter basis). A second group of individuals were fed with varying amounts of nitrogen-free nectar supplemented with fruit flies. Finally, non-reproductive hummingbirds were captured as a control group for analysis of organ mass and size as well as fat content. The maintenance nitrogen requirement of green-backed firecrowns determined by regression was 1.42 mg N day(-1), yet they required nearly 10 mg N day(-1) to maintain body mass. When arthropods were available, we observed that hummingbirds required approximately 150 fruit flies to maintain body mass, which corresponds to a 5\% nitrogen diet. Interestingly, when nectar was restricted (to 4 ml day(-1)), or was absent, arthropods alone were not able to satisfy the body mass balance requirements of hummingbirds, suggesting that arthropods are not adequate as an energy source. In the group offered an 11.1\% nitrogen diet, the size and surface of the small intestine, and liver and kidney mass increased in comparison with the control group (non-reproductive field hummingbirds) or the nitrogen-free group, suggesting a nitrogen overload. Our results are in agreement with other studies showing low nitrogen requirements by nectarivores. An important point to stress is that nitrogen digestibility declined in the 11.1\% nitrogen diet, which strongly supports our nitrogen absorption saturation hypothesis.},

Birds fed diets stored at low RH (50\%) were heavier and had a better feed conversion efficiency (FCE) than those on diets stored at high RH (80\%). Diet storage temperature had no significant effect oil body weight of birds but FCE was improved when birds were maintained on diets stored at a low temperature (15 degreesC). Feed intake was unaffected by the main factors but the interactive effect of temperature x preservative influenced intake. Liver weight was lowest in birds that consumed feeds stored at a low temperature and low RH. The presence of a detoxifier (MTB 100) in the diet reduced the heart weight of birds by 11\%. Diets stored at the low temperature or RH significantly decreased the weight of the gizzard in birds. Inclusion of the preservative ill the diets also reduced gizzard weight by 4\%. Similarly, gizzard weight was reduced by about 6\% due to the presence of the detoxifier in the diets stored at low temperature. Inclusion of the detoxifier in the diet reduced spleen weight and the inorganic phosphorus concentration in serum. Further studies are required to test a wider range of storage conditions as well as the potential of some of the additives used ill the present trial.},

The organ weight showed a closer correlation to body weight than they did to age.

A micro and ultrastructural study of the lymphoid organs showed that the full development of the lymphoid organs was not achieved until the juvenile stage. The spleen and head kidney had mixed populations of “red” and “white” cells. The head kidney was more lymphoid than the spleen. The thymus involuted quickly during the first 6 months.

	abstract = {During northward migration, blackcaps that arrive to refuel at stopover sites in Israel's Negev Desert have reduced masses of organs that are important in food digestion and assimilation. We tested several predictions from the general hypothesis that smaller organs of digestion ( small intestine and pancreas) and nutrient assimilation ( liver) bring about a lower capacity to consume food and that the organs must be restored before blackcaps can feed and digest at a high rate. We used a fasting protocol to create a group of blackcaps with reduced intestine and liver mass ( reduced by 45\% and 36\%, respectively) compared with controls fed ad lib. Because most of the small intestine's biochemical digestive capacity reside in enterocytes found on villi, we predicted and found that reduced intestinal mass in fasted blackcaps related mainly to changes in enterocytes rather than other cells and tissues such as nonabsorptive crypt cells or underlying muscle. Because migrating blackcaps that stop over to feed begin to increase in body mass only 2 d after arrival, we predicted and found a similar recovery period in blackcaps that were first fasted but then refed - the organ mass, structure, function, and ability to consume food was restored after 2 d of feeding. Another group of food-restricted blackcaps ( fed at one-third ad lib. level) lost similar amounts of body mass as fasted blackcaps but had much greater capacity to consume food than fasted blackcaps, and so we predicted that they would exhibit little or no reduction in alimentary organs relative to controls fed ad lib. A surprising result was that, as in fasted blackcaps, in food-restricted blackcaps, the decreases in masses of small intestine, liver, and pancreas were proportionally greater than the decreases in body mass or in masses of nonalimentary organs ( heart, pectoralis). Food restriction, like fasting, caused a decrease in amount of intestinal mucosa and an alteration in the phenotype of enterocytes. These results are thus not consistent with the general hypothesis, and although they can be rationalized by assuming that blackcaps fed ad lib. have excess digestive capacity, it may also be that the physiological process or processes limiting very high feeding rate lie elsewhere than in the digestive system.},

	abstract = {Concentrations and total organ content of mercury, selenium and cadmium, as well as liver, kidney and body mass were determined in female common ciders from 1997 to 2000 at the East Bay Migratory Bird Sanctuary in the eastern Canadian arctic. In 1997 and 1999, female ciders were collected during the pre-nesting period when they eat copious amounts of food and gain substantial weight in preparation for the rigours of nesting. In 1998 and 1999, female ciders were collected during the mid to late stages of the nesting period when they eat very little, if at all, and, as a consequence undergo dramatic weight loss. Total body mass, liver mass and kidney mass were highest in pre-nesting birds, especially in 1997. They were significantly lower in nesting birds collected in 1998 and 2000. In contrast, mercury and cadmium concentrations were lowest in pre-nesting birds collected in 1997 and 1999 and increased to significantly higher concentrations in nesting birds collected in 1998 and 2000. In contrast to these results, the total contents of mercury in liver and cadmium in kidney did not change significantly over the 4-year period. Hepatic selenium concentrations were relatively stable over the 4-year study period while changes in the total content of selenium in the liver paralleled changes in liver mass and body mass. The results suggest that mercury and cadmium concentrations in female common eiders change in response to normal changes in body and organ mass that occur during the reproductive period. Thus, it may be important to consider body condition or reproductive stage when using common ciders (and perhaps other species of sea ducks) in biomonitoring studies or when interpreting concentrations of metals in tissues in terms of the risk they pose to these ducks.

	abstract = {Rates of standard metabolism (SMR) are highly variable among individuals within vertebrate populations. Because SMR contributes a substantial proportion of an individual's energy budget, among-individual variation in this trait may affect other energetic processes, and potentially fitness. Here, we examine three potential proximate correlates of variation in SMR: organ mass, serum T4 thyroxine and relative mitochondrial content, using flow cytometry. Body-mass-adjusted kidney mass correlated with SMR, but liver, heart, small intestine and gastrocnernius did not. Thyroxine correlated with SMR, as did mitochondrial content. These results suggest several novel proximate physiological and morphological mechanisms that may contribute to among-individual variation in SMR. Variation in SMR may be maintained by diverse environmental conditions. Some conditions, such as low resource availability, may favor individuals with a low SMR, through small organ size, or low thyroxine or mitochondrial content. Other conditions, such as high resource availability, may favor individuals with a high SMR, through large organ size, or high thyroxine or mitochondrial content.},

To date, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP) has been found to be the strongest tumor-initiating PAH ever tested in rodent skin and mammary tumor models. Here we show for the first time that systemic exposure to DBP causes DNA damage in mouse lung tissue. C57BL/6 mice were gavaged with 1, 5 or 20 mg DBP/kg body weight, daily for 10 days. Toxicity of DBP was revealed by a decrease in body and organ weight of mice while no apparent cell death was observed on P815 mastocytoma cells (allograft model) in vitro. However, treatment of P815 cells in vitro with the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of DBP, the fjord region (-)-anti-11,12-diol 13,14-epoxide [(-)-anti-DBPDE], resulted in the total loss of cell viability. Lungs from the animals were removed and subjected to DBP-DNA adduct analysis. A dose dependent adduct formation was revealed by P-33-postlabeling analysis of DNA from lung tissue. The majority of DNA adducts formed in lungs of mice after systemic exposure to DBP were contributed by (-)-anti-DBPDE. The data from this in vivo model are consistent with previous metabolic activation results obtained with DBP in human cells in culture. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

All birds were slaughtered at the end of the experiment - the eighth week. No clinical signs were observed in quails fed 2.5mL formalin/kg feed. Depression, dullness and anorexia were prominent in quails fed 20mL formalin/kg feed. Feed intake, body weight, egg production and egg weight together with absolute and relative weight of organs, erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit were decreased at higher doses, i.e., 10 and 20mL formalin/kg feed. Total serum proteins and globulin significantly increased (PB {\textless} 0.05) in all formalin fed quails compared to control birds. No gross lesions were observed in the 2.5mL formalin/kg fed group. At higher doses (10 and 20mL formalin/kg feed) hemorrhages on the thigh muscles, decreased weight and reduction in area and folds of different segments of oviduct were recorded. Reduced size of liver, heart and kidneys was recorded in quails fed 20mL formalin/kg feed compared to controls and other birds. The histopathological changes in oviduct consisted of degeneration of mucosal glands characterized by vacuolation of nuclei of cells. It was concluded from the study that formalin feeding to female quails at 2.5 mL/ kg feed is without harmful effects, however, higher doses are not without health risks.},

	abstract = {The functional anatomy of the pelvic limb of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) was investigated in order to assess musculoskeletal specialization related to locomotor performance. The pelvic limbs of ten ostriches were dissected and detailed measurements of all muscle tendon units of the pelvic limb were made, including muscle mass, muscle length, fascicle length, pennation angle, tendon mass and tendon length. From these measurements other muscle properties such as muscle volume, physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), tendon cross-sectional area, maximum isometric muscle force and tendon stress were derived, using standard relationships and published muscle data. Larger muscles tended to be located more proximally and had longer fascicle lengths and lower pennation angles. This led to an expected proximal to distal reduction in total muscle mass. An exception to this trend was the gastrocnemius muscle, which was found to have the largest volume and PCSA and also had the highest capacity for both force and power production. Generally high-power muscles were located more proximally in the limb, while some small distal muscles (tibialis cranialis and flexor perforatus digiti III), with short fibres, were found to have very high force generation capacities. The greatest proportion of pelvic muscle volume was for the hip extensors, while the highest capacity for force generation was observed in the extensors of the ankle, many of which were also in series with long tendons and thus were functionally suited to elastic energy storage.},

	abstract = {The normal organ morphology and function in fishes varies according to several natural factors, and such variability is found in liver. Knowledge about the normal liver microanatomy is fundamental to pathological evaluation. Even though gender and temperature are important factors for modulating morphophysiological processes in fishes, their influences on liver stroma are virtually unknown. Because temperature- and gender-related changes exist in liver parenchyma, we predict both factors should also influence the normal stromal structure. Using Nile tilapia as a model, we undertook a study to: 1) establish baseline quantitative structural data on the hepatic stroma (and intimately associated pancreatic acini); 2) compare data with those available from other species, namely, salmonids that do not have a liver with pancreatic acini; and 3) test our hypothesis that, within normal healthy limits, the stroma and its structural components may vary significantly with temperature and gender. We used 1-year-old male and female specimens acclimated to 17°C (breeding noncompatible) and 27°C (breeding compatible) for 45 days. Basic morphometric fish parameters were recorded. After estimation of liver volume, the organ was sliced and pieces systematically sampled for light microscopy. Stereology allowed estimation of the relative volumes of organ components. The total volumes were computed by combining the relative volumes with the total liver volumes. Nile tilapia of both genders, held at 17 vs. 27°C, showed structural quantitative differences in the relative volumes of stroma and most of its components, and in the total volumes of certain stromal elements. The total volume of the stroma and of associated pancreatic acini did not differ. We first established that, in fishes, the total amount (volume) of liver biliary ducts and of eosinophilic granule cells might significantly change (increase and decrease, respectively) with a higher acclimation temperature. Indeed, virtually all the stereological changes were, essentially, temperature-and not gender-related. At 27°C, parallel changes in the parenchyma caused a decreased liver volume and hepatic-somatic index (HSI). The relative volumetric proportion of stroma vs. parenchyma in tilapia is higher than in salmonids. The differences found in this study could not be detected with a qualitative approach, thus stressing the importance of using stereology for analyzing histological patterns and for establishing reliable baseline values in healthy conditions. It was also anticipated that in experimental settings with fish the baseline liver stromal architecture may be different according to temperature and breeding status; in consequence, the effects of the tested variable may also diverge. Our data do not fully explain the lower liver volume and HSI at 27°C, thus justifying studies on the parenchyma, particularly on cell size and number. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Eggs from a meat-type breeder flock were incubated under EF of 30kV/m, 60Hz during the first 18 days of incubation as compared with the control incubation (C). Chickens from the two incubation treatments were fed ad libitum and their immune system were monitored. Measurements were made of body weight (BW), and lymphoid organs weight (thymus, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius (BOF)) of birds at 21 and 42 days of age. Immune systems of birds were tested for specific antibody responses to sheep red blood cell (SRBC) and Newcastle disease vaccine (NDV), in vivo T-lymphocyte proliferation responses to phytohaemagglutimin (PHA), and in vitro to concanavalin A (Con-A). EF incubation of eggs did not significantly (P {\textgreater} 0.05) influence BW of bird, absolute weight of lymphoid organs and weight of thymus, and BOF as a percentage of BW of bird (\% BW) at 21 and 42 days of age, humoral immune responses as measured by antibody responses to SRBC and NDV, and cell-mediated immune responses as measured by T-lymphocyte proliferation responses to PHA, and Con-A of birds when compared with those of the C treatment. EF incubation of eggs significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased spleen weight as a \% BW at 21 and 42 days of age when compared with those incubated under the C treatment. Birds at 42 days of age had significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher BW, lymphoid organ weight, and weight of BOF as a \% BW, and lower spleen weight as a \% BW when compared with those of 21 days of age.

	abstract = {During the evolution of therian mammals, the two-segmented, sprawled tetrapod limbs were transformed into three-segmented limbs in parasagittal zig-zag configuration (three-segment limb hypothesis). As a consequence, the functional correspondence of limb segments has changed (now: scapula to thigh, upper arm to shank, fore arm plus hand to foot). Therefore, the scapula was taken into account in the current study of the postnatal growth of the postcranial skeleton in two small mammalian species (Tupaia glis, Galea musteloides). Comparisons were made between the functionally equivalent elements and not in the traditional way between serially homologous segments. This study presents a test of the three-segment limb hypothesis which predicts a greater ontogenetic congruence in the functionally equivalent elements in fore and hind limbs than in the serially homologous elements. A growth sequence, with decreasing regression coefficients from proximal to distal, was observed in both species under study. This proximo-distal growth sequence is assumed to be ancestral in the ontogeny of eutherian mammals. Different reproductive modes have evolved within eutherian mammals. To test the influence of different life histories on ontogenetic scaling during postnatal growth, one species with altricial juveniles (Tupaia glis) assumed to be the ancestral mode of development for eutherians and one species with derived, precocial young (Galea musteloides) were selected. The growth series covered postnatal development from the first successive steps with a lifted belly to the adult locomotory pattern; thus, functionally equivalent developmental stages were compared. The higher number of allometrically positive or isometrically growing segments in the altricial mammalian species was interpreted as a remnant of the fast growth period in the nest without great locomotor demands, and the clearly negative allometry in nearly all segments in the precocial young was interpreted as a response to the demand on early locomotor activity. Different life histories seem to have a strong influence on postnatal ontogenetic scaling; the effects of the developmental differences are still observable when comparing adults of the two species.

In the present work the effects of maslinic acid on growth, protein-turnover rates and nucleic-acid concentration on liver were investigated in the rainbow trout. Five groups of 120 fish of a mean body mass of 20 g were fed for 225 days with diets containing 0, 1, 5, 25 and 250 mg of maslinic acid per kg diet. At the end of the experiment, whole-body and liver weight and growth rate of trout fed with maslinic acid were higher than controls. The highest weight increase was registered for the group fed 250 mg kg(-1), representing a 29\% increase over controls. The total hepatic DNA or liver cell hyperplasia levels in trout fed with 25 and 250 mg of maslinic acid kg(-1) were 37\% and 68\% higher than controls. Also in these same groups of trout, fractional and absolute hepatic protein-synthesis rates were significantly higher than in control, and significant increments in hepatic protein-synthesis efficiency and protein-synthesis capacity were reported. In close agreement with these results, microscopy studies showed that trout fed on 25 and 250 mg kg(-1) hepatocytes appeared to be more compact, with a larger rough-endoplasmic reticulum and larger glycogen stores than controls. These results suggest that maslinic acid can act as a growth factor when added to trout diet. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

One thousand and eight unsexed day-old broiler chicks (Ross-308) originating from the two breeder flocks were randomly allocated to three treatment groups of 336 birds each. Dietary treatments were: a control and two diets containing 24 mg/kg or 48 mg/kg of an essential oil mixture. There were no significant effects of dietary treatment on body weight of the broilers at 21 and 42 days. The effect of the age of the parents did not have a significant effect on body weight of the broilers at 21 and 42 days of age. Up to 21 days the feed intake of broilers from young breeders was reduced significantly as a result of the inclusion of the essential oil mixture in their diets, and a significant improvement in feed conversion ratio was recorded in these birds. Difference in regression coefficients for feed intake and feed conversion ratio between broilers from young and old breeder flocks was significant. Carcass yield and some internal organ weights such as the liver, pancreas, proventriculus, gizzard and small intestine were not affected by the addition of the essential oil mixture to the diet. Inclusion of essential oil mixture to the diet decreased mortality significantly at 21 days.},

Information on biochemical or histological endpoints in birds is lacking; therefore, a two-year study was conducted to provide information needed to develop diagnostic criteria for chlorfenapyr toxicosis. In the first year, male mallard ducks were fed concentrations of 0, 2, 5, or 10 ppm technical chlorfenapyr or 5 ppm of a formulated product in their diet during a 10-week chronic exposure study. Survival, body weight, feed consumption (removal), behavior, and molt progression were monitored. Feed and liver were analyzed for chlorfenapyr and two metabolites. Five of 10 ducks in the 10-ppm group died, and neurotoxic effects were observed in the Sand 10-ppm groups. Feed removal increased for ducks receiving chlorfenapyr and body weights of 5- and 10-ppm ducks were reduced. Loss of body fat, muscle atrophy, and bile retention were suggestive of metabolic disruption or a decreased ability to digest and absorb nutrients. Liver and kidney weights and liver and kidney weight/body weight ratios exhibited a positive response to concentrations of chlorfenapyr in the diet. Emaciation and elevated organ weight/body weight ratios are candidates for a suite of indicators of chronic chlorfenapyr exposure. Liver is the preferred tissue for chemical confirmation of exposure.},

	abstract = {Mean stomach fullness provides a useful index for quantifying fish diets. However, estimating stomach fullness for planktivorous fishes can be time-consuming and prone to error because of small prey and unidentifiable remains. In this study we developed a predictive equation for estimating the stomach volume of yellow perch Perca flavescens as a function of total length (TL). We then used an optical plankton counter (OPC) to estimate the biovolume of invertebrate prey consumed. The OPC quickly estimated the digital size and abundance of zooplankton prey, which can then be converted to estimates of prey biovolume. Stomach volume (V [mm(3)]) for yellow perch (113-279 mm TL) was significantly related to body size (L [mm]) and was estimated as V = 3 x 10(-7) . L-2.96. Using the OPC, yellow perch stomach contents (99\% Daphnia pulex) were converted to prey biovolume (mm(3)) and then divided by stomach volume (mm 3) to estimate stomach fullness (\%). This approach provided reasonable estimates of stomach fullness ranging from 3\% to 85\% (mean = 21\%). Although the initial cost for the OPC equipment is relatively high, this method provided substantial time and labor savings compared with traditional approaches for quantifying zooplankton abundance and biomass (e.g., microscopic identification and enumeration and length-mass conversions). Similarly, the OPC can be used to estimate the abundance and biomass of freshwater zooplankton, thus reducing the time and costs associated with traditional plankton analyses. The approach is limited, however, in cases where very small prey ({\textless}250 mu m) are a dominant proportion of the sample because of the potential errors involved in detecting and estimating the biovolumes of small particles.},

	abstract = {Among socially monogamous birds, standard metrics suggest that males are only similar to 5\% larger than females. An untested assumption is that, with the exception of reproductive systems, males and females are scaled mirror images of one another. I used external morphological and skeletal data, and information on muscle mass and organ size, to test this assumption in a population of breeding Eastern Kingbirds (Tyrannus tyrannus). Male and female Eastern Kingbirds exhibited no differences in body mass or standard measures of size, except in a longer (similar to 6\%) wing chord and tail in males. However, keel length, a character rarely measured in the field, was 9.7\% larger in males. In principal component analysis, overall body size (PC1) failed to differ between the sexes unless keel length was included. Analysis of 16 skeletal characters also showed that only the bones associated with flight were larger in males. However, the most significant differences between the sexes was that lean dry pectoral muscle mass (LDPMM) was nearly 30\% greater in males, whereas the alimentary tract was 27.5\% heavier in females. Females also carried more fat. In both sexes, LDPMM scaled in a positive allometric manner with body mass (i.e., slope {\textgreater} 1.0), but the significantly higher slope of males suggested especially strong selection for large muscle mass and, presumably, greater power generation during flight. Eastern Kingbirds thus exhibit pronounced cryptic sexual size dimorphism, but it is not clear whether natural or sexual selection is responsible. These data call for a broader perspective for measuring and a re-evaluation of sexual size dimorphism in other socially monogamous species.},

	abstract = {The morphometric parameters of the brains of several mammals and primates show differences that are likely to be associated with cognitive and other functions necessary for survival as well as evolution. Seven human and eight baboon formalin-fixed brains were used to show comparative aspects. The whole brains were weighed, 3 from humans and 3 from baboons were separated into components-cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem- and their weights were recorded. The linear measurements of the cerebrum were occipito-frontal (O-F), frontotemporal (F-T) temporo-occipital (T-O), height of temporal lobe (HTL), inter: frontal pole (FF), occipital pole (O-O), parietal (P-P), temporal pole (T-T), and occipital lobe (OL-OL) from superior, lateral and inferior aspects. The proportions of brain weight relative to body weight and those of the brain components were mostly higher in the humans. The length, height and width of the human brains were higher than in the baboons. F-F was six times O-O in humans while other parameters were nearly double in humans as compared to baboons. The ratio of P-P to F-F was nearly 20 times in baboons as compared to 6 times in humans. The overall increase in human brain length, width and size of lobes could be related to increased body size, functional complexity, upright posture, and evolution. The lateral expansion in the size of the frontal, temporal and occipital lobes may be due to the complex circuitry associated with cognitive functions and life style. Several approaches have been proposed to determine factors related to increases in brain size, function and intelligence. Morphometry could be one tool to “explain” specific increases in brain areas.},

To explore how mice exploit such extreme environments, we compared growth rate, morphology and reproductive success of animals reared under differing thermal regimes (13 degrees C `cool', 22 degrees C `moderate' and 30 degrees C `warm') in laboratory mice derived from wild stock. `Warm' group young were smaller and grew more slowly than those from other groups. At 6 weeks of age, body mass was less in `warm' than in `cool' treatment individuals; and liver mass/body mass also was less in `warm' than in `cool' treatment individuals. Paired kidney mass/body mass and paired adrenal mass/body mass were less in `warm' than in `cool' and `moderate' treatment mice. Low heritability values indicate that these effects were from the temperature treatments rather than genetic influences. Irrespective of temperature treatment, females were more likely to produce a litter from post-partum matings if they were experienced, rather than young or reproductively naive, and also bore more young from post-partum matings. These observations contribute to understanding of the sudden plague activities of mice in some parts of Australia and also their sparse distribution in the interior of the continent.

At 1 degrees C, growth in mass was positive for SG cod but negative for BF cod, whereas growth in length did not differ from 0 for both SG and BF cod. Liver size represented a larger proportion of body mass in SG cod at both low and high temperatures, and citrate synthase activity in the intestine exhibited a strong inverse relationship to temperature. The maximum growth capacity of SG cod was comparable with that of cod of similar size in various other stocks in the Atlantic.

	abstract = {The proposition that increased energy expenditure shortens life has a long history. The rate-of-living theory ( Pearl 1928) states that life span and average mass-specific metabolic rate are inversely proportional. Originally based on interspecific allometric comparisons between species of mammals, the theory was later rejected on the basis of comparisons between taxa ( e. g., birds have higher metabolic rates than mammals of the same size and yet live longer). It has rarely been experimentally tested within species. Here, we investigated the effects of increased energy expenditure, induced by cold exposure, on longevity in mice. Longevity was measured in groups of 60 male mice maintained at either 22 degrees C (WW) or 10 degrees C ( CC) throughout adult life. Forty additional mice were maintained at both of these temperatures to determine metabolic rate ( by stable isotope turnover, gas exchange, and food intake) as well as the mass of body and organs of subsets of animals at four different ages. Because energy expenditure might affect longevity by either accumulating damage or by instantaneously affecting mortality rate, we included a third group of mice exposed to 10 degrees C early in life and to 22 degrees C afterward (CW). Exposure to cold increased mean daily energy expenditure by ca. 48\% (from 47.8 kJ d(-1) in WW to 70.6 kJ d(-1) in CC mice, with CW intermediate at 59.9 kJ d(-1)). However, we observed no significant differences in median life span among the groups (WW, 832 d; CC, 834 d; CW, 751 d). CC mice had reduced body mass (lifetime mean 30.7 g) compared with WW mice (33.8 g), and hence their lifetime energy potential (LEP) per gram whole-body mass had an even larger excess than per individual. Greenberg (1999) has pointed out that the size of the energetically costly organs, rather than that of the whole body, may be relevant for the rate-of-living idea. We therefore expressed LEP also in terms of energy expenditure per gram dry lean mass or per gram “metabolic” organ mass (i.e., heart, liver, kidneys, and brain). No matter how it was expressed, LEP in CC mice significantly exceeded that of WW mice. This result demonstrates that increased energy expenditure does not shorten life span and adds evidence to the intraspecific refutation of the rate-of-living theory. We suggest that increased energy expenditure has both positive and negative effects on different factors determining life span and that the relationship between energy turnover and longevity is fundamentally nonmonotonic.},

However, there is currently a paucity of data from the Xenarthra and Afrotheria, two major phylogenetic groups that diverged close to the base of the eutherian mammal adaptive radiation. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the distribution and morphology of neocortical neurons stained for nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein, calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin, and neuropeptide Y in three xenarthran species-the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), the lesser anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla), and the two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus)-and two afrotherian species-the rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the black and rufous giant elephant shrew (Rhynchocyon petersi). We also studied the distribution and morphology of astrocytes using glial fibrillary acidic protein as a marker. In all of these species, nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein-immunoreactive neurons predominated in layer V. These neurons exhibited diverse morphologies with regional variation. Specifically, high proportions of atypical neurofilament-enriched neuron classes were observed, including extraverted neurons, inverted pyramidal neurons, fusiform neurons, and other multipolar types. In addition, many projection neurons in layers II-III were found to contain calbindin. Among interneurons, parvalbumin- and calbindin-expressing cells were generally denser compared to calretinin-immunoreactive cells. We traced the evolution of certain cortical architectural traits using phylogenetic analysis. Based on our reconstruction of character evolution, we found that the living xenarthrans and afrotherians show many similarities to the stem eutherian mammal, whereas other eutherian lineages display a greater number of derived traits. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Recent palaeoatmospheric models suggest large-scale fluctuations in ambient oxygen level over the past 550 million years. To better understand how global hypoxia and hyperoxia might have affected the growth and physiology of contemporary vertebrates, we incubated eggs and raised hatchlings of the American alligator. Crocodilians are one of few vertebrate taxa that survived these global changes with distinctly conservative morphology. We maintained animals at 30°C under chronic hypoxia (12\% O2), normoxia (21\% O2) or hyperoxia (30\% O2). At hatching, hypoxic animals were significantly smaller than their normoxic and hyperoxic siblings. Over the course of 3months, post-hatching growth was fastest under hyperoxia and slowest under hypoxia. Hypoxia, but not hyperoxia, caused distinct scaling of major visceral organs - reduction of liver mass, enlargement of the heart and accelerated growth of lungs. When absorptive and post-absorptive metabolic rates were measured in juvenile alligators, the increase in oxygen consumption rate due to digestion/absorption of food was greatest in hyperoxic alligators and smallest in hypoxic ones. Hyperoxic alligators exhibited the lowest breathing rate and highest oxygen consumption per breath. We suggest that, despite compensatory cardiopulmonary remodelling, growth of hypoxic alligators is constrained by low atmospheric oxygen supply, which may limit their food utilisation capacity. Conversely, the combination of elevated metabolism and low cost of breathing in hyperoxic alligators allows for a greater proportion of metabolised energy to be available for growth. This suggests that growth and metabolic patterns of extinct vertebrates would have been significantly affected by changes in the atmospheric oxygen level.},

	abstract = {Background: This study was designed to evaluate the safety of PolyGlycopleX (R) (PGX (R)), a novel viscous dietary polysaccharide (fiber), when administered to Sprague Dawley (R) rats in the diet for 90 days. Methods: Groups of ten male and ten female rats each consumed PGX mixed in the diet at levels of 0, 1.25, 2.5 or 5.0\% for 90 days, then evaluated for toxicological effects on parameters that included neuromotor activity, body weight, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, hematology, and histopathology. Results: Mean body weight, mean feed consumption and food efficiency in the treated groups were generally comparable to controls for both male and female rats. No changes were noted in neuromotor behavior, and histopathological analysis revealed no significant changes between treated and control animals. There were no differences in mean organ weight, organ-to-body weight or organ-to-brain weight values between controls and treated animals. Decreased red blood cell count occurred in the high dose males and increases in aspartate and alanine aminotransferase enzyme levels and triglycerides, while significant decreases in serum sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations were observed in the females fed 5.0\% PGX. However, the decreased mineral concentrations may be the result of significantly increased urinary volume in both males and females at the high dose, with a concomitant decrease in urinary specific gravity (males and females) and protein concentration (females). These results were within historical control values, did not correlate with any histopathological changes, and were not considered adverse. Conclusion: The results indicate a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for PGX at 5.0\% of the diet, corresponding to an average daily intake of 3219 and 3799 mg/kg bw/day in male and female rats, respectively.},

The treatments were: i) negative control (C, no additive); ii) MOS 1 g per kg of diet and iii) SC 1 g per kg of diet (strain SC47, 300x10(10) CFU/kg). Body weight (BW) and feed intake were determined for each of the two week intervals. Twenty-four birds were slaughtered and eviscerated to determine carcass, carcass parts and internal organ weights at 20 wks of age. Meat colour and pH levels were measured 24 h after slaughter. The dietary treatments did not affect BW and average daily gain during the trial (p{\textgreater}0.05). The average daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio of turkey toms fed with MOS were higher than those of control and SC groups during the overall period (p{\textless}0.05). The dietary treatments did not affect carcass yield, breast meat, thigh, wing, liver, heart, empty gizzard, intestine, and abdominal fat pad proportions and meat pH, composition and pigmentation (p{\textgreater}0.05).

Microscopic examination of different tissues of male rats showed minor histopathological changes in brain, liver, testis, epididymis and adrenal. The activity of testicular enzymes SDH, G-6-PDH and testicular content of sialic acid and cholesterol were found increased in animals of high dose (9 mg kg(-1)d(-1)). There was decrease in RBC counts and levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (HCT) with increase in WBC counts. While, total protein was decreased significantly at all the dose levels in testes and epididymis, glucose level showed a significant decrease at high dose. A dose dependent increase was observed in the level of serum triglycerides.

Our data on eleven collared and four white-lipped peccaries suggest that peccaries have a small relative stomach volume compared to other foregut fermenters, which implies a comparatively lower fermentative capacity and thus forage digestibility. The forestomach could enable peccaries to deal, in conjunction with their large parotis glands, with certain plant toxins (e.g. oxalic acid).

	abstract = {During the sea water phase, Atlantic salmon is exposed to shifting environmental conditions affecting the physiology and metabolism of the fish. Strategic dietary supplements may enable the fish to sustain a higher growth rate during particular periods. In this experiment, a combination of two amino acids (L-arginine and L-glutamate, with supplementation levels 1.1\% and 0.75\%, respectively) was used as dietary supplements since earlier observations have indicated that these amino acids have versatile functions, influencing growth, reproduction and the immune response in animals. In the case of arginine, the control diet was set at assumed requirement level, while the test diet was supplemented further. The effects of this supplementation on feed intake and growth parameters were studied, as well as selected organ weight, biochemical, molecular and hormonal indicators. During the first experimental period (May-July), few significant effects were found. However, in the second period of the experiment ( July-September), a higher specific feeding rate (SFR), thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and specific growth rate (SGR) (p{\textless}0.05) occurred in fish fed the supplemented diet, together with a trend (p{\textless}0.1) for increased final body weight. The measured gene expression levels of Insulinlike growth factor (IGF) and growth hormone receptor gene did not correlate with the increased growth observed during the second period in fish fed the supplemented diet. Furthermore, no difference in total plasma IGF-I concentrations was found after the first period. After the second period, fish fed the supplemented diet had in fact a significantly lower plasma IGF-I level. Additionally, we found a higher relative weight of gastrointestinal sections and elevated levels of plasma arginine, urea and ornithine after the second period in fish fed the supplemented diet. We conclude that dietary supplementation of L-arginine and L-glutamate significantly increased feeding rate and growth during the second feeding period in autumn. This response appeared to occur when the two conditions of rapidly decreasing day lengths and high feed intake, were met (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic flexibility during moult has never been explored in austral nomadic ducks. We investigated whether the body condition, organ (pectoral muscle, gizzard, liver and heart) mass and flight-feather growth Egyptian geese Alopochen aegyptiaca in southern Africa show phenotypic flexibility over their 53-day period of flightless moult. Changes in body mass and condition were examined in Egyptian geese caught at Barberspan and Strandfontein in South Africa. Mean daily change in primary feather length was calculated for moulting geese and birds were dissected for pectoral muscle and internal organ assessment. Mean body mass and condition varied significantly during moult. Body mass and condition started to decrease soon after flight feathers were dropped and continued to do so until the new feathers were at least two-thirds grown, after which birds started to regain body mass and condition. Non-moulting geese had large pectoral muscles, accounting for at least 26\% of total body mass. Once moult started, pectoral muscle mass decreased and continued to do so until the flight feathers were at least one-third grown, after which pectoral muscle mass started to increase. The regeneration of pectoral muscles during moult started before birds started to gain overall body mass. Gizzard mass started to increase soon after the onset of moult, reaching a maximum when the flight feathers were two-thirds grown, after which gizzard mass again decreased. Liver mass increased significantly as moult progressed, but heart mass remained constant throughout moult. Flight feather growth was initially rapid, but slowed towards the completion of moult. Our results show that Egyptian geese exhibit a significant level of phenotypic flexibility when they moult. We interpret the phenotypic changes that we observed as an adaptive strategy to minimize the duration of the flightless period. Moulting Egyptian geese in South Africa undergo more substantial phenotypic changes than those reported for ducks in the northern hemisphere.},

Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) and Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) are two sympatric rodent species in Inner Mongolian grasslands of China. It has been shown that Brandt's voles have higher metabolic rate than Mongolian gerbils. In this study, we elucidated the inter-specific variation in BMR integratively from the molecular levels to whole organism. Our results showed that differences in organ mass were not good predictors for the observed variations in BMR, while variations in the activity of thyroid hormones and the metabolic biochemical markers of tissues, such as mitochondria density, cytochrome c oxidase activity and state 4 respiration, were strongly correlated with variations in BMR, and there was also a positive relationship between residuals of T-3/T-4 and state 4 respiration, suggesting that thyroid hormones play an important role in the determination of BMR variations.

	abstract = {The human brain stands out among mammals by being unusually large. The expensive-tissue hypothesis(1) explains its evolution by proposing a trade-off between the size of the brain and that of the digestive tract, which is smaller than expected for a primate of our body size. Although this hypothesis is widely accepted, empirical support so far has been equivocal. Here we test it in a sample of 100 mammalian species, including 23 primates, by analysing brain size and organ mass data. We found that, controlling for fat-free body mass, brain size is not negatively correlated with the mass of the digestive tract or any other expensive organ, thus refuting the expensive-tissue hypothesis. Nonetheless, consistent with the existence of energy trade-offs with brain size, we find that the size of brains and adipose depots are negatively correlated in mammals, indicating that encephalization and fat storage are compensatory strategies to buffer against starvation. However, these two strategies can be combined if fat storage does not unduly hamper locomotor efficiency. We propose that human encephalization was made possible by a combination of stabilization of energy inputs and a redirection of energy from locomotion, growth and reproduction.},

Despite an initial accelerated weight gain of Bmal1(-/-) mice, body weight and subcutaneous (SC) and gonadal (GON) adipose tissue mass were comparable to Bmal1(+/+) mice at the end of the diet period. Noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging scanning revealed a modest increase in fat content in Bmal1(-/-) mice after 10 weeks of HFD, whereas at the start and the end of the HFD feeding no differences were observed between both genotypes. After 15 weeks of HFD, adipocyte and blood vessel size and density were similar for Bmal1(+/+) and Bmal1(-/-) mice. However, the weight of major organs was significantly reduced in Bmal1(-/-) mice, confirming the premature ageing phenotype. Thus, we hypothesize that an initial accelerated increase in body weight and fat mass of Bmal1(-/-) mice on HFD may have been offset by the effect of premature ageing on organ weight, resulting in comparable weights after 15 weeks of HFD.},

New data on brain weight and body weight from 162 necropsied adult individuals, and a second series on body weight and gut size from 59 individuals, are compared with previously published reports based on smaller samples as well as large databases derived from museum records. We confirm elevated brain sizes for Cebus and Saimiri and also report that Cacajao and Chiropotes have relatively large brains. From more limited data we show that gut size and brain mass have a strongly inverse relationship at the low end of the relative brain size scale but a more diffuse interaction at the upper end, where platyrrhines with relatively high encephalization quotients may have either relatively undifferentiated guts or similar within-gut proportions to low-EQ species. Three of the four main platyrrhine clades exhibit a wide range of relative brain sizes, suggesting each may have differentiated while brains were relatively small and a multiplicity of forces acting to maintain or drive encephalization. Alouatta is a likely candidate for de-encephalization, although its starting point is difficult to establish. Factors that may have compelled parallel evolution of relatively large brains in cebids, atelids and pitheciids may involve large social group sizes as well as complex foraging strategies, with both aspects exaggerated in the hyper-encephalized Cebus. With diet playing an important role selecting for digestive strategies among the seed-eating pitheciins, comparable in ways to folivores, Chiropotes evolved a relatively larger brain in conjunction with a moderately large and differentiated gut.

In order to understand the physiological processes behind this ecological pattern. we studied the morphophysiological changes that D. gliroides exhibits after dietary acclimation, in a sample of 21 wild-caught individuals fed over 1 month with ad libitum diet of: (1) fruit, (2) insects or (3) a mix of insects and fruit. In addition, we measured oxygen consumption (VO2) at resting conditions. We also performed enzyme assays (sucrase. maltase. trehalase and aminopeptidase N) and measurements of organ morphology. We found that D. gliroides cannot fulfil its nutrient requirements only from insects or fruit. It needs a mixed diet in order to maintain its body mass and energy balance. However, as a response of diet acclimation, individuals showed several-fold changes in the activities of aminopeptidase-N. maltase and sucrase (but not trehalase). This result, both the magnitude of change and the simultaneous effects on three enzymes suggests that D. gliroides could exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity in the activity of intestinal enzymes. This study suggests also that D. gliroides, the only living representative of the Microbiotheria order, exhibits physiological adaptations to a generalist diet. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The objective was to determine the effect of long-term dietary supplementation of two types of fish oil on lipid composition and steroidogenesis in adult pig testis. Twenty-four Duroc boars, aged 204.5 +/- 9.4 d (body weight 128.1 +/- 16.7 kg) received daily 2.5 kg of an iso-caloric basal diet supplemented with: 1) 62 g of hydrogenated animal fat (AF); 2) 60 g of menhaden oil (MO) containing 16\% of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 18\% of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); or 3) 60 g of tuna oil (TO) containing 7\% of EPA and 33\% of DHA. After these diets were consumed for 7 mo, testicular hormones, phospholipid content, and fatty acid composition of individual phospholipids in testis were determined. Body and reproductive organ weights were not significantly affected by dietary treatments. Testicular tissue from boars fed a TO diet, followed by those receiving MO and AF diets, had the lowest level of phosphatidylethanolamine (TO {\textless} MO {\textless} AF; P {\textless} 0.01) but the highest sphingomyelin (TO {\textgreater} MO {\textgreater} AF; P {\textless} 0.01). For each phospholipid, boars fed either the MO or TO diet had increased total omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA (P {\textless} 0.01), by reciprocal replacement of total omega-6 fatty acids (20:4n-6, 22:5n-6). The MO diet increased EPA more than the other diets. Testicular concentrations of testosterone and estradiol were lower in boars fed a TO diet than a MO diet (P {\textless} 0.02). In conclusion, long-term dietary supplementation of fish oil, regardless of the EPA/DHA ratio, modified the fatty acid compositions in testis and affected steroid production of healthy adult boars, which may represent a promising models for future studies on fertility.

	abstract = {Postprandial physiological and morphological responses to feeding were examined in juvenile southern catfish (Silurus meridionalis Chen) that had consumed a loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus Cantor) meal equivalent to 6 \% of the body mass of the catfish. The gastric evacuation rate (GER) peaked at 4 h postfeeding, averaging 0.36 g food weight h(-1), at which time 14 \% of the ingested meal had passed into the intestine. Less than 10 \% of the ingested meal remained in the stomach at 24 h postfeeding. Pepsin activity peaked at 8 h postfeeding, reaching a level approximately twofold higher than the prefeeding level. Pancreatic trypsin activity peaked at 16 h postfeeding, reaching a level 4.5-fold higher than the prefeeding level. Peaks in lipase activity in both the proximal and middle intestinal segments occurred at 16 h, reaching 2.8- and 2.4-fold higher levels than the prefeeding level, respectively, while the activity in the distal intestine segment reached a level 2.9-fold higher than the prefeeding level at 24 h postfeeding. With respect to amylase activity, only the middle intestinal segment exhibited a change, first an increase and then a decrease, after feeding. Feeding also triggered an approximately 200 \% increase in the metabolic rate and resulted in 44.6 kJ kg(-1) being expended on specific dynamic action, equivalent to 16.1 \% of the meal's energy. In terms of organ size, the wet mass of the liver increased by 11 \% at 24 h postfeeding, whereas the wet mass of the pancreas did not change. Except for a decrease in the thickness of the submucosa in the middle intestinal segment, the thickness of the intestinal fold, mucosa, submucosa, muscularis and serosa of each intestinal segment did not change significantly with feeding. These results suggest that the continuum of physiological responses observed with respect to metabolic increases, GER, regulation of pancreatic and intestinal digestive enzyme activities and liver wet mass to feeding corresponds to the changes in the demand on the digestive system in S. meridionalis. Moreover, species maintained stable gastrointestinal tract morphology during the short interval of repeated feeding.},

	abstract = {Northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) are faced with energetically expensive seasonal challenges that must be met to ensure survival, including thermoregulation in winter and reproductive activities in summer. Contrary to predictions of life history theory that suggest breeding metabolic rate should be the apex of energetic effort, winter metabolism exceeds that during breeding in several temperate resident bird species. By examining whole-animal, tissue and cellular function, we ask whether seasonal acclimatization is accomplished by coordinated phenotypic plasticity of metabolic systems. We measured summit metabolism ((V) over dot(O2,sum)), daily energy expenditure (DEE) and muscle oxidative capacity under both winter (December to January) and breeding (May to June) conditions. We hypothesize that: (1) rates of energy utilization will be highest in the winter, contrary to predictions based on life history theory, and (2) acclimatization of metabolism will occur at multiple levels of organization such that birds operate with a similar metabolic ceiling during different seasons. We measured field metabolic rates using heart rate telemetry and report the first daily patterns in avian field metabolic rate. Patterns of daily energy use differed seasonally, primarily as birds maintain high metabolic rates throughout the winter daylight hours. We found that DEE and (V) over dot(O2,sum) were significantly greater and DEE occurred at a higher fraction of maximum metabolic capacity during winter, indicating an elevation of the metabolic ceiling. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in mass or oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. These data, highlighting the importance of examining energetic responses to seasonal challenges at multiple levels, clearly reject life history predictions that breeding is the primary energetic challenge for temperate zone residents. Further, they indicate that metabolic ceilings are seasonally flexible as metabolic effort during winter thermoregulation exceeds that of breeding.},

The daily feed intake per hen was significantly increased in the mean value of the total laying period of the 5 mu g B-12-Group compared to the other B-12-Groups and the Control. The laying intensity was ranged between 90 to 93 \% and was not different between groups. The egg weight and the daily egg mass production were significantly increased with supplementation of vitamin B-12 (all groups) and B-12 x Co. Feed conversion was significantly improved in the group with 5 mu g B-12 per kg feed and also the combination B-12 x Co. The supplementation of 5 to 20 mu g B-12 to the diet significantly increased the final hen body weight. Co alone without B-12 in the diet significantly increased the mass of the eggs and did not change the other laying parameters. Supplementation of diets with vitamin B-12 or Co or both additives didn't directly improve the egg composition and the yolk colour. The results of slaughtering showed that supplementation of 20 mu g B-12 the liver mass decreased significantly and the haematocrit content increased significantly compared to the Control and the 0.6 mg Co-Group. The supplementation of 0.6 mg Co significantly increased the spleen mass. The results allow the conclusion that a supplementation of 5 mu g vitamin B-12 per kg laying hen feed was sufficient to compensate the deficiencies on feed intake and laying performance. An additional supplementation of Co to feed does not have additional advantages for the birds.},

In this study, we assessed the extent of intraspecific variation in metabolic rate within a group of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) and tested whether the observed variation in residual (body-mass-corrected) SMR, MMR, and absolute aerobic scope could be explained by variations in the residual size (mass) of metabolically active internal organs. Residual SMR was found to correlate positively with residual MMR, indicating a link between these two metabolic parameters, but no relationship between organ mass and metabolic rate was found for liver, heart, spleen, intestine, or stomach. Instead, activity in the liver of two aerobic mitochondrial enzymes, cytochrome c oxidase and, to a lesser extent, citrate synthase, was found to correlate with whole-animal metabolic rate, indicating that causes for intraspecific variation in the metabolic rate of fish can be found at a lower organizational level than organ size.},

	abstract = {Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites of fungi. Animal feeds can be easily infected by fungi during production and storage, resulting in mycotoxin contamination. This study was performed to evaluate the possible health risks of mycotoxin-contaminated feed for cockatiels. The occurrence of mycotoxins in commercial parrot feeds (5 seed mixes and 5 pelleted feeds) was investigated by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The following 12 mycotoxins were detected: zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, fusarenon X, aflatoxin B-1, sterigmatocystin, alternariol, alternariol methylether, fumonisin B-1, fumonisin B-3, and ochratoxin A. Zearalenone was the most prevalent. Pathological effects after 21 days feeding mycotoxin-contaminated diets were examined in an in vivo trial with 3 groups of 5 cockatiels: group 1 (control) was fed a non-contaminated pelleted feed; group 2 was fed a pelleted feed containing zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, and fumonisins; and group 3 was fed a pelleted feed containing fumonisins. Average body weight gain and relative organ weight were not significantly different between the treatment groups and the control group. Apoptosis of renal tubular cells, diarrhoea, reduced appetite, enlargement of liver, kidney and proventriculus were occasionally observed in the birds from groups 2 and 3. In summary, contamination with mycotoxins is common in parrot feeds. The mycotoxin levels did not reach toxic levels, but might pose a potential threat to some sensitive cockatiels.},

	abstract = {When choose feeding applied in poultry breeding birds can adjust their ration and this may be considered in terms of animal welfare and performance and carcass quality improvement. The complete ration costs may be higher than individual feedstuffs. When breeders achieved satisfactory results with choice feeding based on cereals they can obtain economical advantages. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of free choice feeding based on emmer (Triticum dicoccon), triticale (Triticale) and wheat (Triticum sp.) on Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) growth performance, inner organ traits and intestinal viscosity. In the experiment, basal diet and ground emmer, triticale and wheat were offered separately in two different feeders. The treatments were: (1) Control (C, basal diet), (2) C and emmer (CE) (3) C and triticale (CT) and (4) C and wheat (CW). A total of 240 three-day-old Japanese quail were randomly distributed to 4 equal groups with 6 replicate and fed for 35 d. Body weight (BW) and feed intake (FI) were determined at 3, 10, 24 and 38 d of age. Carcass and inner organ weights were determined at end of the experiment. Intestinal viscosity was measured. There was no difference among the group in terms of BW at 3 d (p{\textgreater}0.05), but on d 10, 24 BW of C group was higher than other groups and BW of wheat group was higher than CE and CT group at 10 d (p{\textless}0.01). The BW of CE group was higher than C and CW group at 38 d (p{\textless}0.01). The body weight gain (BWG) in the C group was higher than CE and CT groups at 3 to 10 days but C group's BWG was lower than CE and CW groups at 24 to 38 days (p{\textless}0.01). The BWG of CE group's was higher than C and CW groups at 3 to 38 d (p{\textless}0.01). The FI and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of quail were not statistically influenced (p{\textgreater}0.05) by the treatments. There was no difference among the groups in terms of mortality. The carcass yield, liver, small intestine, heart and total gastrointestinal tract ratio were not statistically influenced by the free choice feeding based on triticale emmer and wheat (p{\textgreater}0.05). However, in the wheat group's gizzard ratio was higher than triticale and emmer groups and in this group abdominal fat pad was higher than other groups (p{\textless}0.01). Intestinal viscosity of quail was not influenced by choice feeding (p{\textgreater} 0.05). These results show that ground emmer, triticale and wheat may be given separately together as basal ration and some advantageous in performance may gain with choice feeding based on emmer.},

	abstract = {Aim: To evaluate the effect of different levels of High Bentonite on growth performance, organ weight and serum biochemistry in broiler fed on diets containing aflatoxin. Materials and Methods: A total of 360 day-old commercial broiler chicks were divided at random into 8 dietary treatment groups of 42 chicks each having 3 replicates. Dietary levels of aflatoxin (0.5 ppm) and High-grade bentonite (0.5, 0.75 and 1.00\%) were tested in a completely randomized design manner, forming a total of 8 dietary treatments each with three replicates. Body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly. At 5 wk, six birds from each treatment were sacrificed and liver, kidney, gizzard, pancreas, spleen, bursa of Fabricius and thymus were extracted and weighed. The serum samples were analyzed for total proteins, uric acid, serum albumin, serum globulin and the activities of gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine amino transferase (ALT) and for antibody titers against Newcastle disease (ND) and infectious bursal disease (IBD) using ELISA technique. Results: A significant (P{\textless}0.05) decrease in body weight, feed consumption, relative weights of bursa, thymus, serum protein, anti body titers against NDV and IBDV, and increase in FCR, mortality, relative weight of liver, kidney, and the activity of Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) was observed. However, the relative weights of gizzard, pancreas, spleen, serum albumin, uric acid and the activity of Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) were not influenced by inclusion of AF or HGB. Conclusion: The addition of HGB restored the harmful effects of AF on body weight, feed consumption, FCR, mortality, relative weight of liver, kidney, serum protein, IBDV and NDV. Supplementation of high grade bentonite at 1.0 per cent level was found to be beneficial in ameliorating the adverse effects of aflatoxin (AF) in broiler chickens.},

	abstract = {The question of how the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass (M) is achieved in animals is unresolved. Here, we tested the cell metabolism hypothesis and the organ size hypothesis by assessing the mass scaling of the resting metabolic rate (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), erythrocyte size, and the masses of metabolically active organs in the crucian carp (Carassius auratus). The M of the crucian carp ranged from 4.5 to 323.9 g, representing an approximately 72-fold difference. The RMR and MMR increased with M according to the allometric equations RMR = 0.212M(0.776) and MMR=0.753M(0.785). The scaling exponents for RMR (b(r)) and MMR (b(m)) obtained in crucian carp were close to each other. Thus, the factorial aerobic scope remained almost constant with increasing M. Although erythrocyte size was negatively correlated with both mass-specific RMR and absolute RMR adjusted to M, it and all other hematological parameters showed no significant relationship with M. These data demonstrate that the cell metabolism hypothesis does not describe metabolic scaling in the crucian carp, suggesting that erythrocyte size may not represent the general size of other cell types in this fish and the metabolic activity of cells may decrease as fish grows. The mass scaling exponents of active organs was lower than 1 while that of inactive organs was greater than 1, which suggests that the mass scaling of the RMR can be partly due to variance in the proportion of active/inactive organs in crucian carp. Furthermore, our results provide additional evidence supporting the correlation between locomotor capacity and metabolic scaling.},

	abstract = {Background: Poultry strains used by the industry have been submitted to intensive genetic selection for rapid growth and increased efficiency of feed utilisation along with a high metabolic rate. As major consequences a loss in the immune system competency and increased sensibility to stressors are pointed out. Several nutritional strategies have been essayed to alleviate immuno-suppression in broilers, including the administration of rich 3n-polyunsaturated fatty acids. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of fish oil and green tea feeding in broilers chicks humoral immunity using different challenges and the weight of immunity-related organs. Materials, Methods \& Results: In the present study, different combinations of fish oil (FO) and green tea powder (GrT) supplements were tested in a 3x3 combination of supplement proportions (0\%, 1.5\% and 2\% FO and 0\%, 1\% and 1.5\% GrT), in a total of 270 Ross 308 broilers, to analyse the effects of supplementation on the humoral immune response to challenges against Influenza and Newcastle virus (antibody titers) and to SRBC (immunoglobulin production) and also in the weight of liver and main lymphoid organs at slaughter. At the end of the study, the carcass weight was similar between groups and to the reported in other studies for the same age at slaughter. On respect to the responses to viral challenges, the GrT supplementation failed to show advantageous effects, compared to FO supplemented groups; when combined with 2\% FO the decrease in the humoral response was frequently negatively related to GrT proportions in co-supplementation treatments. However, no significant differences were found between treatment groups. As for the viral challenging, little, non-significant changes were found associated to FO or GrT supplementation. With exception for the group treated with 2\% FO plus 1\% GrT a slightly non-significant increase in total Igs production was recorded one and 2-weeks after challenging, reflecting the increase in IgM production. No statistical differences were found between treatments in the unpluck body weight at slaughter, suggesting that no constraints in fed intake were associated with supplementation, in contrast to the reported in some GrT studies. Moreover, little non-significant variations were found in the liver, spleen, thymus or bursa of Fabricius weights. Still, on respect to thymus weight, the supplementation with 1.5\% FO significantly improved the relative organ weight, in particular if associated with 1.5\% GrT. Also, the bursa of Fabricius weight was significantly increased in groups supplemented of 2\% FO plus 1\% GrT, compared to all the other treatment groups. Discussion: In the present study, slightly improved humoral responses against influenza were found in groups under 2\% FO supplementation thought these beneficial effects could be antagonised by higher GrT co-supplements. Moreover, the humoral response to Newcastle virus challenging was positively influenced by FO supplementation and again these effects could be partially reversed by GrT co-supplementation. This is in part supported by the available literature. It has been demonstrated that improvement of humoral responses with fish oil are dose dependant, with birds fed with higher levels of FO showing higher antibody titers than those feed medium or low levels. Still, it is also acknowledged that increased FO incorporation rates (above 3 to 4\%) in diets result in fish flavours in poultry meat and compromise the consumer acceptance of the product. In conclusion, no detrimental effects were found in association with the supplementation regimens tested, but the irregular responses found with some of the combinations used in the present study need clarification in further studies, with a larger number of birds.},

	abstract = {The Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus) is a seasonal mammal responding to the annual cycle in photoperiod with anticipatory physiological adaptations. This includes a reduction in food intake and body weight during the autumn in anticipation of seasonally reduced food availability. In the laboratory, short-day induction of body weight loss can be reversed or prevented by voluntary exercise undertaken when a running wheel is introduced into the home cage. The mechanism by which exercise prevents or reverses body weight reduction is unknown, but one hypothesis is a reversal of short-day photoperiod induced gene expression changes in the hypothalamus that underpin body weight regulation. Alternatively, we postulate an exercise-related anabolic effect involving the growth hormone axis. To test these hypotheses we established photoperiod-running wheel experiments of 8 to 16 weeks duration assessing body weight, food intake, organ mass, lean and fat mass by magnetic resonance, circulating hormones FGF21 and insulin and hypothalamic gene expression. In response to running wheel activity, short-day housed hamsters increased body weight. Compared to short-day housed sedentary hamsters the body weight increase was accompanied by higher food intake, maintenance of tissue mass of key organs such as the liver, maintenance of lean and fat mass and hormonal profiles indicative of long day housed hamsters but there was no overall reversal of hypothalamic gene expression regulated by photoperiod. Therefore the mechanism by which activity induces body weight gain is likely to act largely independently of photoperiod regulated gene expression in the hypothalamus.},

Here, we investigated variation in the size of digestive organs in 4 populations of Abrothrix olivacea and A. longipilis, both inhabiting 2 contrasting habitats. Based on published data on diet composition, we predicted that individuals from the more-productive forest habitat should show larger digestive organs than individuals from the less-productive steppe habitat. As expected, we found that individuals from the forest had significantly larger small and large intestines (relative to body mass) than individuals from the steppe. In addition, we found that individuals from the forest had a larger body size than individuals from the steppe, suggesting that habitat productivity has an important effect on body size.},

	abstract = {AimWe assessed the phenotypic responses of body size and organ weights of two small rodent species (Myodes glareolus and Apodemus flavicollis) to elevation, a surrogate for temperature and other environmental conditions. We expected not only an increase in body size (Bergmann's rule), but also an increase in relative heart weight with increasing elevation (Hesse's rule). LocationThe Bohemian Forest, south-eastern Germany. MethodsWe measured body length, body mass, and mass of the heart, lung, liver, kidneys and spleen of 386 adult specimens (188 of A flavicollis and 198 of M. glareolus) from 28 localities at 300-1450m a.s.l., and also recorded the number of ectoparasites. We analysed body length using linear mixed models, with site as a random factor and species, sex, population density and elevation as fixed factors, and included all two-way interactions between species and the remaining fixed variables. For the organ masses, we included body length and body mass in the calculations to account for allometric variation of organ mass with body size. For a subset of individuals, we sequenced the mitochondrial D-loop to analyse genetic variation along the elevational gradient. ResultsFor both species, we found no support for Bergmann's rule. The body size of A. flavicollis even decreased with elevation. In contrast, the relative heart weight of both species significantly increased with elevation, thereby supporting Hesse's rule. Lung mass also increased with elevation. The mass of other internal organs showed no such consistent relationship with elevation. Neither species showed genetic differentiation across the elevational gradient. Main conclusionsOur results suggest that both rodent species respond to increasing elevation by decreasing overall energy expenditure and by increasing overall aerobic capacity. In the context of climate change, our results indicate that biogeographers should pay more attention to the potential significance of genetic and/or phenotypic plasticity of relative organ mass to environmental heterogeneity.},

Prior to feeding experiment, fish of various sizes were examined their stomach volume, using freshly prepared stomachs ligatured at the tips of the burret, where the maximum amount of distilled water collected in the stomach were measured (ml). Stomach volume is correlated with maximum food intake (Smax) and it can estimate the maximum stomach distension by allometric model i.e volume=0.0000089W2.93. Gastric emptying time was estimated using a qualitative X-radiography technique, where the fish of various sizes were fed to satiation at different time since feeding. All the experimental fish was feed into satiation using radio-opaque barium sulphate (BaSO4) paste injected in the wet shrimp in proportion to the body weight. The BaSO4 was found suitable to track the movement of feed/prey in the stomach over time and gastric emptying time of scats fish can be estimated. The results of qualitative X-Radiography observation of gastric motility, showed the fish (200 gm) that fed to maximum satiation meal (circa 11 gm) completely emptied their stomach within 30 - 36 hrs. The results of the present study will provide the first baseline information on the stomach volume, gastric emptying of scats fish in captivity. ©2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

In snakes, MAP increases in proportion to the increased distance between the heart and the head, when the heart-head vertical distance is expressed rho gh (where rho is the density of blood, g is acceleration due to gravity and h is the vertical distance above the heart), and the rise in MAP is associated with a larger heart to normalize wall stress in the ventricular wall. Based on measurements of MAP in Burmese pythons ranging from 0.9 to 3.7 m in length (0.20-27 kg), we demonstrate that although MAP increases with body mass, the rise in MAP is merely half of that predicted by heart-head distance. Scaling relationships within individual species, therefore, may not be accurately predicted by existing interspecific analyses.},

Birds were individually weighed and randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups (control, 4.7 mg DON/kg and 11 mg DON/kg). Feed intake and cockerels' body weight were not affected by the dietary treatment, nor were the relative organ weights affected. On the other hand, breast muscle relative weight was increased in the cockerels fed DON contaminated diets, while the relative weight of ileum and caecum were significantly decreased at the same time. The content of urea was significantly increased in plasma of cockerels fed the highest DON concentrations, while the triglyceride concentration was significantly lower in plasma of cockerels fed 4.7 mg/kg DON. Haematological and other clinical-chemical parameters remained unaffected. Moreover, crude fat utilization was progressively increased as the concentrations of DON in the diet increased. Utilizations of organic matter, carbohydrates and nitrogen balance were not affected by the dietary treatment. Furthermore, the long term feeding of cockerels with DON contaminated wheat had no negative impact on semen parameters. Taken together, it might be concluded that cockerels are quite resistant to the effects of DON regarding reproductive traits, nutrient digestibility and feed intake. The dose-dependent alterations in the relative weights of breast muscle and digestive organs require further consideration.},

	abstract = {A 12-laying months experiment with laying hens of two different genetic backgrounds was conducted to evaluate the effect of feeding of DON contaminated wheat on performance, egg components and health of the hens and the effect of the breed of the laying hens on the sensitivity towards DON. A total of 216, 23 weeks old laying hens (108 Lohmann Brown, LB, and Lohmann Selected Leghorn, LSL, respectively) were assigned to the feeding trial with increasing concentrations of DON (0, 3.4, 9.9 mg/kg) resulting in 6 experimental groups of 36 hens each. All birds were caged individually and had free access to feed and water. Eggs were collected three times during the experience for the evaluation of egg quality. At the end of the experiment 20 laying hens per group were slaughtered. Blood was collected for haematology. Liver, spleen, heart, breast muscle, glandular stomach and gizzard were dissected, emptied (glandular stomach and gizzard), and weighed. Tissues for histological examination were collected directly after slaughtering. Significant adverse effect of DON was noticed on the laying intensity, body weight and weight gain of the laying hens; laying intensity was significantly decreased due to the presence of DON in the diet in the second laying period while laying intensity of the LSL hens was significantly higher than the LB hens. Moreover, a decrease in life body weight and lower weight gain ratio was detected in the LB hens fed 9.9 mg/kg DON, while the LSL hens were not significantly affected by the dietary treatment. The relative weight of breast muscle of the LB hens fed 9.9 mg/kg DON was significantly lower than that of other LB groups, while the relative weight of liver was significantly higher. on the other hand, breast muscle and liver relative weights of the LSL hens were not significantly affected by the dietary treatment. Haematocrit and concentrations of white blood cells were not significantly affected by the dietary treatment while significant breed differences were observed. Moreover, DON contaminated wheat resulted in reduction in the eggshell proportion of the eggs of the LB hens fed 9.9 mg DON/kg diet at the 40 th and 60 th week of life while LSL eggs were not significantly affected. Overall, it can be concluded that the performance and health of the laying hens was adversely affected by the presence of DON in hen's diet at the highest level (9.9 mg/kg) but to a different extent and depending on the breed of the laying hens.},

Their growth rate, body musculature and plumage color reflected the American conservative breeds belonging to Heritage Turkeys. The FG group included commercial, heavy BUT Big 6 hybrids. All poults were hatched under the same incubation conditions. Each group comprised 80 birds. The turkeys were reared until the 22nd week of life and had access to a free range area. The aim of this study has been to determine the differences in the quality of femur (osteometric and strength features) originating from slow-growing (SG) and fast-growing (FG) turkeys. In the future this will allow for developing hybrid turkeys intended for organic and free-range production. It has been assumed that if there are differences in bone strength, then they can be detected by means of instrumental research methods: mechanical and contact acoustic emission. In addition, the relationships between the mechanical, acoustic and osteometric parameters have been studied. The osteometric properties of the femur differed distinctly between the fast-growing (FG) and slow-growing (SG) turkeys. The breaking resistance of femoral bones depended on turkey genotype. The bones of heavier FG birds were stronger than those of SG turkeys, measured by breaking and acoustic energy tests. The osteometric characteristics (density, thickness and the length of the shaft, weight) of turkey bones strongly negatively correlated with breaking stress and positively with the strength, fracture energy and the number of acoustic emission events. However, the proportion of the femur bone weight related to body weight strongly positively correlated with bone breaking stress. © Verlag Eugen Ulmer, Stuttgart.},

The effect of water restriction on the growth performance was compared in Naked Neck (NNK) and Ovambo (OVB) chickens that are predominant in Southern Africa. A total of 54 eight-wk-old pullets each of NNK and OVB chickens with an initial average weight of 641 +/- 10 g/bird were randomly assigned to three water intake treatments, each having six birds for 8 wk. The water restriction treatments were ad libitum, 70\% of ad libitum and 40\% of ad libitum intake. Nine experimental pens with a floor space of 3.3 m(2) per strain were used. The pens were housed in an open-sided house with cement floor deep littered with a 20 cm layer of untreated wood shavings. Feed was provided ad libitum. Average daily water intake (ADWI), BW at 16 weeks of age (FBW), ADG, ADFI, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and water to feed ratios (WFR) were determined. Ovambo chickens had superior (p{\textless}0.05) FBW, ADG and ADWI than NNK chickens. Body weight of birds at 16 weeks of age, ADG, ADFI, ADWI, and WFR declined progressively (p{\textless}0.05) with increasing severity of water restriction while FCR values increased (p{\textless}0.05) as the severity of water restriction increased. Naked Neck chickens had better FCR at the 40\% of ad libitum water intake level than Ovambo chickens. The dressing percentage per bird was higher in water restricted birds than those on ad libitum water consumption, irrespective of strain. Heart weight was significantly lower in birds on 40\% of ad libitum water intake than those on ad libitum and 70\% of ad libitum water intake, respectively. In conclusion, NNK chickens performed better than OVB chickens under conditions of water restriction and would be ideal to raise for meat and egg production in locations where water shortages are a major challenge.},

	abstract = {In birds and mammals the metabolic response to fasting has been studied and can be characterized by three consecutive phases reflecting metabolic and physiological adjustments. An effective way to minimize energy expenditure during food scarcity is to decrease the mass of the organs. As the digestive system is metabolically expensive to maintain, the small intestine and the liver are the most affected organs. We evaluated the effects of phase III starvation on the mass of the different organs and histological parameters on house sparrows, a small non-migrant bird. In a short period of time (34h) we observed a larger reduction in the digestive organ mass when compared to the mass of the body and non-alimentary tissues. Furthermore, the intestinal mass was proportionally more reduced than its length and nominal surface area. A reduction on the intestinal mucosal layer also resulted in a shortening of villus (length and thickness) and crypt depth. Moreover, the morphology of the enterocytes changed from cylindrical to cubical, suggesting that the surface exposed to the lumen was conserved. This may indicate an adaptive response to the moment of refeeding. The nominal surface area/body mass remained constant in both groups and several histological parameters were reduced, suggesting that starving induces the atrophy of the small intestine. However, the goblet cells were conserved after fasting indicating a protective tendency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Glutamine is the preferred fuel for the rat small intestine and promotes the growth of intestinal mucosa, especially in the event of gut injury. Quantitatively, glutamine is one important precursor for intestinal citrulline release. The aim of this study was to determine whether the effect of glutamine on the increase in intestinal villus height is correlated with an increase in both gut mass and citrulline plasma level in very old rats. We intermittently supplemented very old (27-mo) female rats with oral glutamine (20\% of diet protein). Intestinal histomorphometric analysis of the small bowel was performed. Amino acids, in particular citrulline, were measured in the plasma, liver and jejunum. Markers of renal (creatinine, urea) and liver (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) functions were measured to evaluate renal and liver functions in relation to aging and to glutamine supplementation. Liver glutathione was also determined to evaluate cellular redox state. Glutamine supplementation maintains the body weight of very old rats, not by limiting sarcopenia but rather by increasing the organ mass of the splanchnic area. Total intestine mass was significantly higher in glutamine-supplemented rats than in controls (15\%). Measurement of villus height and crypt depth demonstrated that the difference between villus and crypt was significantly improved in glutamine pre-treated rats compared to controls (similar to 11\%). Plasma citrulline also increased by 15\% in glutamine-supplemented rats compared to controls. Citrulline appears as a biomarker of enterocyte mass in villous atrophy associated with advanced age. Non-invasive measurement of this metabolite may be useful in following the state of the gastrointestinal tract in very old people, whose numbers are increasing worldwide and the care of whom is a major public health issue. The gut may contribute to the malnutrition caused by malabsorption frequently observed in the elderly.},

For 90 days, froglets were fed a diet with 30\% HH1 rice, 30\% parental rice (Minghui 63, MH63), or no rice as a control. Body weight and length were measured every 15 days. After sacrificing the froglets, we performed a range of biological, clinical, and pathological assessments. No significant differences were found in body weight (on day 90: 27.7 +/- 2.17, 27.4 +/- 2.40, and 27.9 +/- 1.67 g for HH1, MH63, and control, respectively), body length (on day 90: 60.2 +/- 1.55, 59.3 +/- 2.33, and 59.7 +/- 1.64 mm for HH1, MH63, and control, respectively), animal behavior, organ weight, liver and kidney function, or the microstructure of some tissues between the froglets fed on the HH1-containing diet and those fed on the MH63-containing or control diets. This indicates that frog development was not adversely affected by dietary intake of Cry1Ab/1Ac protein.},

	abstract = {In the present study, the effect of varying levels of ochratoxin A (OTA) in the diet of broiler chickens was investigated. Day-old broiler chicks (200) were divided into 5 treatment groups (T-1- control; T-2 - T-1 + 100 ppb OTA; T-3 - T-1 + 200 ppb OTA; T-4 - T-1 + 300 ppb OTA; and T-5 - T-1 + 400 ppb OTA. Each diet was fed to 4 replicated groups of 10 birds each from day- old to 42 days of age. During overall growth period (0-6 weeks), body weight gain (BWG) in T-3, T-4 and T-5 was significantly lower than that of control group, whereas, the BWG of group T-2 was statistically similar to that of control. OTA contamination at 200 ppb or higher resulted in significant reduction in BWG of broiler chicken. The overall feed intake (FI) in T-5 was significantly lower than that of control group (T-1). The FI in groups T-2, T-3 and T-4 was statistically similar to that of control. OTA contamination at 200 ppb or higher resulted in poor FCR and thus deteriorating feed utilization efficiency in broilers. OTA at 200 ppb or at higher level resulted in increased mortality. Addition of 100 ppb OTA in diet did not produce any change in relative weights of liver, kidney and bursa of Fabricius, however, OTA contamination at 200 ppb or higher resulted in increased relative weights of liver and kidney; and reduced relative weight of bursa of Fabricius. Inclusion of 100 ppb OTA in diet did not produce any change in biochemical parameters of broiler chicken also. It was concluded that ochratoxin A up to 100 ppb in diet had no adverse effect on growth performance, organ weight and certain biochemical parameters in broiler chicken.},

In this study, the air-dried stem bark of Cratoxylum arborescens was extracted consecutively with hexane, chloroform and methanol. The hexane extract was chromatographed, fractionated and purified to yield AM. The toxic effects of AM have not been completely investigated; therefore, the current study investigates its in vitro cytotoxicity on WRL-68 normal cells and in vivo effects on renal and hepatic histobiochemical parameters, relative organ weight, lipid profile, peroxidation and reduced glutathione of ICR female and male mice. AM was fed orally at single doses of 0 (as normal group), 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight. The results showed that AM did not show adverse effects on body weight, organ weight, serum biochemistry, histopathology and oxidative stress biomarkers. On the other hand, this natural compound showed low cytotoxic activities against normal liver cells (WRL-68) with IC50 = 65 mu g/ml.

	abstract = {Interspecific studies of adult mammals show that heart mass (M-h, g) increases in direct proportion to body mass (M-b, kg), such that M-h proportional to M-b(1.00). However, intraspecific studies on heart mass in mammals at different stages of development reveal considerable variation between species, M-h proportional to M-b(0.70-1.00). Part of this variation may arise as a result of the narrow body size range of growing placental mammals, from birth to adulthood. Marsupial mammals are born relatively small and offer an opportunity to examine the ontogeny of heart mass over a much broader body size range. Data from 29 western grey kangaroos Macropus fuliginosus spanning 800-fold in body mass (0.084-67.5 kg) reveal the exponent for heart mass decreases significantly when the joey leaves the pouch (ca. 5-6 kg body mass). In the pouch, the heart mass of joeys scales with hyperallometry, Mh(in-pouch) = 6.39 M-b(1.10) (+/- 0.05), whereas in free-roaming juveniles and adults, heart mass scales with hypoallometry, M-h(postpouch) = 14.2M(b)(0.77 +/- 0.08). Measurements of heart height, width, and depth support this finding. The relatively steep heart growth allometry during in-pouch development is consistent with the increase in relative cardiac demands as joeys develop endothermy and the capacity for hopping locomotion. Once out of the pouch, the exponent decreases sharply, possibly because the energy required for hopping is independent of speed, and the efficiency of energy storage during hopping increases as the kangaroo grows. The right : left ventricularmass ratios (0.30-0.35) do not change over the body mass range and are similar to those of other mammals, reflecting the principle of Laplace for the heart.},

Our results showed that there were no significant differences among groups receiving 100 mu g L-1 or 10 mu g L-1 Cry1Ca and the blank control in terms of time to completed metamorphosis, survival rate, body weight, body length, organ weight and liver enzyme activity after being exposed to the Cry1Ca (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Although some detection indices in the rice straw groups were significantly different from those of the blank control group (P {\textless} 0.05), there was no significant difference between the T1C-19 and MH63 rice straw groups. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the mortality rate, body weight, daily weight gain, liver and fat body weight of the froglets between the T1C-19 and MH63 dietary groups after 90 days, and there were no abnormal pathological changes in the stomach, intestines, livers, spleens and gonads. Thus, we conclude that the planting of transgenic cry1Ca rice will not adversely affect frog development.},

	abstract = {Environmental cues play important roles in the regulation of an animal's physiology and behavior. One such cue, photoperiod, plays an important role in the seasonal acclimatization of birds. It has been demonstrated that an animal's body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and energy intake, are all affected by photoperiod. The present study was designed to examine photoperiod induced changes in the body mass, metabolism and metabolic organs of the silky starling, Sturnus sericeus. Captive silky starlings increased their body mass and BMR during four weeks of acclimation to a short photoperiod. Birds acclimated to a short photoperiod also increased the mass of certain organs (liver, gizzard and small intestine), and both gross energy intake (GEI) and digestible energy intake (DEI), relative to those acclimated to a long photoperiod. Furthermore, BMR was positively correlated with body mass, liver mass, GEI and DEI. These results suggest that silky starlings increase metabolic thermogenesis when exposed to a short photoperiod by increasing their body and metabolic organ mass, and their GEI and DEI. These findings support the hypothesis that bird species from temperate climates typically display high phenotypic flexibility in thermogenic capacity.},

However, no similar study has been made of the development of these traits in ectotherms. For comparison, we therefore investigated the metabolism, growth and muscle mitochondrial function in hatchlings of a turtle and a crocodilian, two ectotherms that never develop endothermy. Metabolic rate did not increase substantially in either species by 30 days post-hatching. Yolk-free body mass and heart mass did not change through 30 days in alligators and heart mass was a constant proportion of body mass, even after 1 year. Yolk-free body mass and liver mass grew 36\% and 27\%, respectively, in turtles during the first 30 days post-hatch. The mass-specific oxidative phosphorylation capacity of mitochondria, assessed using permeabilized muscle fibers, increased by a non-significant 47\% in alligator thigh and a non-significant 50\% in turtle thigh over 30 days, but did not increase in the heart. This developmental trajectory of mitochondrial function is slower and shallower than that previously observed in ducks, which demonstrate a 90\% increase in mass-specific oxidative phosphorylation capacity in thigh muscles over just a few days, a 60\% increase in mass-specific oxidative phosphorylation capacity of the heart over a few days, and disproportionate growth of the heart and other organs. Our data thus support the hypothesis that these developmental changes in ducks represent mechanistic drivers for attaining endothermy.},

	abstract = {The differing limb dynamics and postures of small and large terrestrial animals may be mechanisms for minimising metabolic costs under scale-dependent muscle force, work and power demands; however, empirical evidence for this is lacking. Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are highly dimorphic: males have greater body mass and relative muscle mass than females, which are permanently gravid and have greater relative intestinal mass. Furthermore, leghorns are selected for standard (large) and bantam (small) varieties and the former are sexually dimorphic in posture, with females having a more upright limb. Here, high-speed videography and morphological measurements were used to examine the walking gaits of leghorn chickens of the two varieties and sexes. Hindlimb skeletal elements were geometrically similar among the bird groups, yet the bird groups did not move with dynamic similarity. In agreement with the interspecific scaling of relative duty factor (DF, the proportion of a stride period with ground contact for any given foot) with body mass, bantams walked with greater DF than standards, and females walked with greater DF than males. Greater DF in females than in males was achieved via variety-specific kinematic mechanisms, associated with the presence/absence of postural dimorphism. Females may require greater DF in order to reduce peak muscle forces and minimise power demands associated with lower muscle to reproductive tissue mass ratios and smaller body size. Furthermore, a more upright posture observed in the standard, but not bantam, females, may relate to minimising the work demands of being larger and having proportionally larger reproductive tissue volume. Lower DF in males relative to females may also be a work-minimising strategy and/or due to greater limb inertia (as a result of greater pelvic limb muscle mass) prolonging the swing phase.},

A total of 48 1-day-old chickens were used, half of the chickens were reared in conventional cages (RCC) and the rest in enriched cages (REC). Transport stress was applied in the 17th week. Liver weight decreased, spleen and bursa of Fabricius weights, white blood cell count, CD4+ and CD8+ cell proportions increased due to the transport. Environmental enrichment significantly increased antibody production and tended to increase monocyte percentage and CD8+ cell proportion. The effect of transport on, heterophil (H) and lymphocyte (L) percentages was not significant in RCC chickens. While heterophil percentage and H:L ratio increased, lymphocyte percentage decreased in REC chickens subjected to transport. Transport stress increased heterophil functions both in REC and RCC chickens, but the increase was higher in REC hens than in RCC hens. In conclusion, although environmental enrichment did not neutralize the effect of transport on lymphoid organs, it activated the non-specific immune system, cellular and the humoral branches of the specific immune system by increasing heterophil functions, CD8+ cells and antibody production, respectively. Therefore, environmental enrichment suggested for improving animal welfare may also be beneficial to improve the immune system of birds exposed to stress.},

	abstract = {One-day-old female turkeys were randomly assigned to five dietary treatments and were fed for 15weeks diets containing 5\% of cellulose (control, C) or 5\% of dried fruit pomaces (apple, black currant, strawberry, seedless strawberry; AP, BCP, SP, SSP respectively). In weeks 11-15 of feeding, all diets were supplemented with 2.5\% of linseed oil. The crude fibre content of fruit pomaces ranged from 56.5\% in AP to 62.9\% in SP. In comparison with AP, berry fruit pomaces (BCP, SP and SSP) were characterised by a higher content of neutral detergent fibre - NDF (41.2\% vs. 52.7-59.3\%) and lignin (13.24\% vs. 21.80-25.56\%). A monomer analysis revealed that cellulose was the main non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) in fruit pomaces, whereas their pectin content was low. Polyphenol content was determined at below 6g/kg in AP, at approximately 12g/kg in BCP and SP, and at 32.8g/kg in SSP. There were no significant differences (p{\textgreater}0.05) in final body weight of birds. After 15weeks of feeding fruit pomaces to turkeys, the relative weight of the small intestine with digesta was higher in group AP, and lower in group SSP, as compared to controls. Dietary fruit pomaces decreased the dry matter (DM) concentration and lowered the pH of the small intestinal digesta, except the AP and SSP treatments respectively. In the caeca, significantly reduced concentrations of ammonia or putrefactive short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) upon dietary fruit pomaces were observed. Fruit pomaces did not influence the concentrations or the total pool of short-chain fatty acids, but led to a significant increase in butyric proportion in the SCFA profile at the expense propionate.},

To investigate the effect of these variables on the organ mass of Phrynocephalus vlangalii, 138 individuals belonging to four populations living along an altitudinal gradient in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (China) were dissected to remove heart, lungs, stomach, and intestinal tract. Organ dry mass, individuals' sex, and body mass, as well as mean annual temperature and average air pressure (calculated from a 30-year-data series obtained from the National Climatic Data Center) were subjected to two-way analyses of covariance and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Except for the heart, organ mass varied significantly among populations, although only lung and stomach mass increased significantly with increasing altitude. Males' heart and lung mass was higher than that of females, which might be due to their different behavior and reproductive efforts. GLMM analyses indicated that air pressure had a positive effect on heart, lung and intestinal tract mass, whereas temperature had a negative effect on these three organs. In order to explain the effect of hypoxia and low temperature on P. vlangalii's organ mass, further rigorous study on respiration, energy budget and food intake was encouraged.},

European sea bass of 9.8 +/- 1.5 g and 9.1 +/- 0.5 cm were fed nine isonitrogenous (45\% crude protein) and isolipidic (21\%) diets containing gradually reduced levels of FM and FO as follows (\%FM/\%FO): 58/15, 20/6, 20/3, 10/6, 10/3, 5/6, 5/3 and 0/0. Another diet, 0/0(+), was similar to the 0/0 but supplemented with LC-PUFA from microbial and marine sources. After 90 days of feeding, European sea bass fed the 0/0 diet showed reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) final weight, final length, condition factor, perivisceral fat index and viscero-somatic index as well as feed efficiency, whereas addition of LC-PUFA significantly improved daily growth index (DGI) (0/0(+) diet). Reduction of FM/FO down to 5/3 did not significantly affect fish survival or condition factor, whereas reduction to 5/6 did neither affect sea bass length or feed conversion and reduction down to 10/3 did not affected body weight, DGI and perivisceral fat or visceral weight. FM reductions down to 5\% significantly reduced growth rate. FO substitution by vegetable oils (VO) led to reduced growth and increased liver to body weight ratios, liver lipid deposition and hepatocellular size. In liver and muscle, FO substitution increased n-6 fatty acids (FA) and n-6/n-3 ratio and reduced saturated FA and n-3 LC-PUFA, whereas monounsaturated FA were not increased in proportion to dietary contents. Moreover, FO reduction increased the products from Delta 6 desaturase and elongases, Elovl6 and Elovl5. In conclusion, the results of this study show that it is possible to reduce dietary FM and FO levels down to 10\% and 3\% in mostly plant-based diets without affecting growth performance of European sea bass juveniles.},

	abstract = {The increasing application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been raising concerns about their potential adverse effects to human and the environment. However, the knowledge on the systemic toxicity of AgNPs in mammalian systems is still limited. The present study investigated the toxicity of PVP-coated AgNPs in rats treated with repeated oral administration, and compared that with equivalent dose of AgNO3. Specifically, one hundred male and female rats were orally administrated with particulate or ionic forms of silver (Ag) separately at doses of 0.5 and 1 mgkg(-1) body weight daily for 28 days. The results reveal no significant toxic effects of AgNPs and AgNO3 up to 1 mgkg(-1) body weight, with respect to the body weight, organ weight, food intake, and histopathological examination. Ag distribution pattern in organs of rats treated with AgNPs was similar to that of AgNO3 treated rats, showing liver and kidneys are the main target organs followed by testis and spleen. The total Ag contents in organs were significantly lower in the AgNPs treated rats than those in the AgNO3 treated rats. However, the comparisons between AgNPs and AgNO3 treatments further indicated more potent of AgNPs in biochemical and hematological parameters in rats, including red blood cell count (RBC), platelet count (PLT), white blood cell count (WBC) and aspartate transaminase (AST). Results of this study suggested that particulate Ag at least partially contributed to the observed toxicity of AgNPs, and both ionic and particulate Ag should be taken into consideration in toxicological evaluation of AgNPs.

Similarly, 12 males per strain and the same number of females were placed in each pen in the house. Twelve birds, 4 each of NN, OV, and PK, were randomly selected per paddock and per pen, and tonic immobility (TI) was determined. Ambient temperature and humidity were recorded and fitted into a PROCMIXED model as random effects, with strain and sex as main effects. On the last d of the trial, blood samples were collected from 9 (3 of each strain) randomly selected birds per paddock, via brachial venepuncture, using 5 mL syringes and 22 gauge needles. At slaughter, the liver and spleen were recovered and weighed immediately. Organ weights were expressed relative to body weight (BW) of each bird. Sex of bird influenced (P {\textless} 0.05) BW, spleen, and relative liver weights and heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio. Strain did not influence (P {\textgreater} 0.05) TI but affected (P {\textless} 0.05) all other parameters. Rearing system (P {\textless} 0.05) influenced all parameters. Strain x sex interactions were significant (P {\textless} 0.05) on all organ weights. Males appeared more stressed than females. The free-range system could minimize stress in birds though mechanisms should be devised to prevent attacks by predators.

	abstract = {Seasonal changes in temperature and photoperiod are important environmental cues used by small birds to adjust their body mass (M-b) and thermogenesis. However, the relative importance of these cues with respect to seasonal adjustments in M-b and thermogenesis is difficult to distinguish. In particular, the effects of temperature and photoperiod on energy metabolism and thermoregulation are not well known in many passerines. To address this problem, we measured the effects of temperature and photoperiod on M-b, energy intake, resting metabolic rate (RMR), organ mass and physiological and biochemical markers of metabolic activity in the Chinese bulbul (Pycnonotus sinensis). Groups of Chinese bulbuls were acclimated in a laboratory to the following conditions: (1) warm and long photoperiod, (2) warm and short photoperiod, (3) cold and long photoperiod, and (4) cold and short photoperiod, for 4 weeks. The results indicate that Chinese bulbuls exhibit adaptive physiological regulation when exposed to different temperatures and photoperiods. M-b, RMR, gross energy intake and digestible energy intake were higher in cold-acclimated than in warm-acclimated bulbuls, and in the short photoperiod than in the long photoperiod. The resultant flexibility in energy intake and RMR allows Chinese bulbuls exposed to different temperatures and photoperiods to adjust their energy balance and thermogenesis accordingly. Cold-acclimated birds had heightened state-4 respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity in their liver and muscle tissue compared with warmacclimated birds indicating the cellular mechanisms underlying their adaptive thermogenesis. Temperature appears to be a primary cue for adjusting energy budget and thermogenic ability in Chinese bulbuls; photoperiod appears to intensify temperature-induced changes in energy metabolism and thermoregulation.},

Various animal models of intrauterine growth restriction exhibit reduced heart size at birth, which negatively influences cardiac function in adulthood. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates nutrient and growth factor availability with cell growth, thereby regulating organ size. This study aimed at elucidating a possible involvement of mTORC1 in intrauterine growth restriction and prenatal heart growth. Methods and Results-We inhibited mTORC1 in fetal mice by rapamycin treatment of pregnant dams in late gestation. Prenatal rapamycin treatment reduces mTORC1 activity in various organs at birth, which is fully restored by postnatal day 3. Rapamycin-treated neonates exhibit a 16\% reduction in body weight compared with vehicle-treated controls. Heart weight decreases by 35\%, resulting in a significantly reduced heart weight/body weight ratio, smaller left ventricular dimensions, and reduced cardiac output in rapamycin-versus vehicle-treated mice at birth. Although proliferation rates in neonatal rapamycin-treated hearts are unaffected, cardiomyocyte size is reduced, and apoptosis increased compared with vehicle-treated neonates. Rapamycin-treated mice exhibit postnatal catch-up growth, but body weight and left ventricular mass remain reduced in adulthood. Prenatal mTORC1 inhibition causes a reduction in cardiomyocyte number in adult hearts compared with controls, which is partially compensated for by an increased cardiomyocyte volume, resulting in normal cardiac function without maladaptive left ventricular remodeling. Conclusions-Prenatal rapamycin treatment of pregnant dams represents a new mouse model of intrauterine growth restriction and identifies an important role of mTORC1 in perinatal cardiac growth.},

However, its safety has not yet been established. The objective of this study was to evaluate 4-week repeated oral toxicity and genotoxicity of astilbin. We examined oral toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats after daily oral administration of astilbin at 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Negative control animals received the same volume of the solvent. Astilbin administration did not lead to death, body weight gain, food consumption, or adverse events. There were no significant differences in toxicity between the astilbin and control group; we observed no toxic effects on hematological or urinalysis parameters, biochemical values, organ weight, or histopathological findings. We assessed the genotoxicity of astilbin with the Ames test (TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA1535), chromosomal aberration assay (using Chinese hamster ovary cells), and mammalian micronucleus test (in mice). We found no genotoxicity in any tested strains. The no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) for astilbin in the 4-week repeated oral toxicity study in rats was greater than 500 mg/kg body weight/day, regardless of gender. Results also suggested that astilbin does not have genotoxicity potential. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Substantial increases in cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and gastrointestinal blood flow are essential for euryhaline rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss) osmoregulation in seawater. However, the underlying hemodynamic mechanisms responsible for these changes are unknown. By examining a range of circulatory and cardiac morphological variables of seawater-and freshwater-acclimated rainbow trout, the present study revealed a significantly higher central venous pressure (CVP) in seawater-acclimated trout ( 0.09 vs. -0.02 kPa). This serves to increase cardiac end-diastolic volume in seawater and explains the elevations in SV ( 0.41 vs. 0.27 ml/kg) and CO ( 21.5 vs. 14.2 ml·min-1·kg-1) when compared with trout in freshwater. Furthermore, these hemodynamic modifications coincided with a significant increase in the proportion of compact myocardium, which may be necessary to compensate for the increased wall tension associated with a larger stroke volume. Following a temperature increase from 10 to 16.5°C, both acclimation groups exhibited similar increases in heart rate (Q10 of 2), but SV tended to decrease in seawater-acclimated trout despite the fact that CVP was maintained in both groups. This resulted in CO of seawaterand freshwater-acclimated trout stabilizing at a similar level after warming ( 26 ml·min-1·kg-1). The consistently higher CVP of seawater-acclimated trout suggests that factors other than compromised cardiac filling constrained the SV and CO of these individuals at high temperatures. The present study highlights, for the first time, the complex interacting effects of temperature and water salinity on cardiovascular responses in a euryhaline fish species. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

	abstract = {Human activities in the riparian zone can affect the feeding of stream fish because they alter autochthonous production (periphyton, macrophytes and aquatic insects) and allochthonous inputs (terrestrial insects, leaves, seeds and fruits). In the present study we investigated how the diet and intestinal length of a persistent and generalist fish species (Bryconamericus iheringii, Characidae) responds to riparian modifications in 31 subtropical streams in southern Brazil. We hypothesised that intestinal length would be longer in populations inhabiting streams with converted riparian vegetation as a consequence of greater consumption of an indigestible and low-protein diet. Populations of B. iheringii from streams with a degraded riparian zone and reduced canopy cover had longer intestinal length (after accounting for body size), which was associated with decreased consumption of terrestrial plants and invertebrates and increased ingestion of filamentous algae, macrophytes and detritus. These results indicate that anthropic alteration of riparian zones and increased canopy openness trigger shifts in the diet and intestinal length of B. iheringii. The findings suggest that plasticity in intestinal length is an important characteristic to determine whether fish populations can persist in a variety of habitat conditions and cope with the digestion of a greater proportion of low-quality and low-protein food items in human-altered environments.},

	abstract = {Energy is a major cost component in diets for poultry. We hypothesized that the supplementation of emulsifier blends in broiler diets may contribute to the efficient utilization of energy and in increasing fat digestibility, thereby improving performance. To test our hypothesis, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of a blend of emulsifiers on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, serum lipid profiles, and meat quality of broilers. A total of 768 1-d-old Ross 308 male broiler chicks with an average initial body weight of 45.55 +/- 0.34 g were used in a 35 days feeding trial. Broilers were sorted into 4 treatments, 12 replications per treatment, and 16 birds per pen. Dietary treatments consisted of corn-soybean meal based basal diet and the basal diet supplemented with 0.05\%, 0.075\%, and 0.10\% emulsifier. As a result of this study, the inclusion of 0.05\%, 0.075\%, and 0.10\% emulsifier blends (sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate (SSL) and Tween 20) in the basal diet linearly increased (P = 0.0001) body weight gain (BWG) and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) (linear effect P = 0.0001) on d 7 to 21, d 21 to 35 as well as overall. Broilers fed with different levels of emulsifier blends also showed a linear increment (P {\textless} 0.05) in dry matter (DM) and fat digestibility. A trend of linear reduction (P = 0.051) in low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the serum of broilers fed emulsifier blend was observed. The lightness value of breast muscle color linearly increased (P = 0.001), the redness and yellowness values tended to increase (P = 0.072 and P = 0.094 respectively), and the water holding capacity (WHC) showed trends in reduction (P = 0.078) with an increase in the level of emulsifier blends. With regards to relative organ weight, spleen weight was linearly (P = 0.001) reduced with the increase in the supplemental levels of emulsifier blends. A positive correlation between emulsifier content in the diet and BWG, DM and fat digestibility, and breast muscle color indices, were also observed. In conclusion, emulsifier blend supplementation positively influenced growth performance and nutrient digestibility in broiler chickens.},

The present study was carried out to investigate the safety of the aqueous extract of Codiaeum variegatum leaves on Wistar albino mice and rats of both sexes. Methods: For the acute toxicity study, seven groups of eight mice (four males and four females) each received orally once distilled water (10 ml Kg(-1)) and the aqueous extract in a single dose of 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 g Kg(-1). These mice were observed for mortality after 48 hours and thereafter, for clinical signs daily for 14 days. In the sub-chronic toxicity evaluation, four groups of 12 rats (six males and six females) each received distilled water (10 ml Kg(-1)) and the aqueous extract at doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg Kg(-1) by oral gavage for 28 consecutive days. The body weight was evaluated every 2 days for each animal and after sacrifice, the relative weight of vital organs was determined. Blood serum was used for the analysis of biochemical markers of renal and hepatic toxicity. Results: The administration of the aqueous extract in both acute and sub-chronic toxicity evaluation did not cause neither significant visible signs of toxicity nor mortality and no significant changes were observed on body weight, relative organ weight and biochemical parameters in treated groups compared to the control groups. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that the aqueous extract of Codiaeum variegatum leaves is non-toxic and may be safely used for its therapeutic application.},

However, there is no available research report on the use of l-theanine as a feed additive in ducks. This study was conducted to investigate the potential benefits and appropriate dosages of l-theanine on the growth performance, immune function, serum biochemical parameters, and jejunum morphology and antioxidant capacity of ducks. A total of 600 1-day-old Chaohu ducks were randomly allocated into five dietary treatment groups supplemented with 0 (control group), 300, 600, 900 and 1500 mg/kg of l-theanine. Each group included five replicates of 24 birds each. Body weight at day 28 was increased (P{\textless}0.05) by l-theanine. From days 15 to 28, l-theanine elevated cumulative BW gain (BWG) and cumulative feed intake (FI), and decreased feed to gain ratio. From days 1 to 28, l-theanine elevated (P{\textless}0.05) cumulative BWG and cumulative FI. l-theanine elevated (P{\textless}0.05) the relative weight of bursa of Fabricus (day 14), thymus (day 14), spleen (day 28) and liver (day 28). On day 28, l-theanine decreased (P{\textless}0.05) serum glucose, uric acid, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6 contents, and elevated (P{\textless}0.05) serum total protein, globulin (GLB), immune globulin A (IgA) and IgG contents, but only serum insulin, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 contents was decreased (P{\textless}0.05) and serum GLB and IgM content was elevated (P{\textless}0.05) by l-theanine on day 14. On day 14, l-theanine decreased (P{\textless}0.05) jejunum crypt depth, and elevated (P{\textless}0.05) jejunum villus height, villus height to crypt depth ratio (V/C), goblet cell number and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity. On day 28, l-theanine decreased (P{\textless}0.05) jejunum malondialdehyde content, and elevated (P{\textless}0.05) jejunum villus height, V/C, goblet cell number, and T-SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities. l-theanine levels caused quadratic effect on the growth performance, relative organ weight, serum parameters, jejunum morphology and antioxidant capacity. In conclusion, l-theanine can be used as a promising feed additive for ducks, and its optimal supplementation level was 600 to 900 mg/kg based on the current experimental condition.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary Caecotrophy in small herbivores, including rabbits, is the instinctive behavior of eating soft feces. Little is known about the impact of caecotrophy on growth and metabolism. In the present study, we used an Elizabeth circle to prevent rabbits from eating soft feces and measured changes in feed intake, body weight, internal organ weight, serum biochemical indices and liver lipid droplet accumulation. Liver tissue was also used for transcriptome sequencing. Results indicated that fasting caecotrophy decreased rabbit growth and lipid synthesis in the liver. In order to investigate the effects of fasting caecotrophy on hepatic lipid metabolism in rabbits, 12 weaned female New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into (n = 6/group) a control and fasting caecotrophy group. Rabbits in the experimental group were treated with an Elizabeth circle to prevent them from eating their own soft feces for a 60-day period. Growth and blood biochemical indices, transcriptome sequencing and histology analysis of the liver were performed. Compared with the control group, final weight, weight gain, liver weight, growth rate and feed conversion ratio, all decreased in the experimental group (p {\textless} 0.05). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed a total of 301.2 million raw reads (approximately 45.06 Gb of high-quality clean data) that were mapped to the rabbit genome. After a five-step filtering process, 14,964 genes were identified, including 444 differentially expressed genes (p {\textless} 0.05, foldchange {\textgreater}= 1). A number of differently expressed genes linked to lipid metabolism were further analyzed including CYP7A1, SREBP, ABCA1, GPAM, CYP3A1, RBP4 and RDH5. The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) annotation of the differentially expressed genes indicated that main pathways affected were pentose and glucuronide interactions, starch and sucrose metabolism, retinol metabolism and PPAR signaling. Overall, the present study revealed that preventing caecotrophy reduced growth and altered lipid metabolism, both of which will help guide the development of new approaches for rabbits' feeding and production. These data also provide a reference for studying the effects of soft feces in other small herbivores.},

	abstract = {As organisms face variation in energetic challenges and physiological demands, they often respond with reversible changes in behavior, physiology, and morphology, described as phenotypic flexibility. From the magnitude of phenotypic change, we can infer the energetic challenges of different life stages. We studied phenotypic flexibility in a population of reproductive and pre-migratory female insectivorous bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). While female reproductive demands are well described in insectivorous bats, there are questions regarding the demands of migration. Our objective was to measure phenotypic flexibility to assess the cost of autumn migration compared to reproduction in an insectivorous bat. We measured plasma triglycerides to quantify foraging rate, and body composition (body mass and individual organ mass) of T. brasiliensis throughout the summer season (from arrival in spring through pre-migration/migration departure in autumn) according to the female reproductive cycle. We found phenotypic changes during pre-migration/migration similar to periods of high-energy demand during reproduction (e.g., late pregnancy and lactation). Most notably, bats weighed as much during peak pregnancy, as they did during migration, and the rapid mass gain from post-lactation through the migratory period was due to a combination of hyperphagia and hypertrophy of digestive organs.

	abstract = {Migratory birds undergo impressive body remodelling over the course of an annual cycle. Prior to long-distance flights, red knots (Calidris canutus islandica) reduce gizzard mass while increasing body mass and pectoral muscle mass. Although body mass and pectoral muscle mass are functionally linked via their joint effects on flight performance, gizzard and pectoral muscle mass are thought to be independently regulated. Current hypotheses for observed negative within-individual covariation between gizzard and pectoral muscle mass in free-living knots are based on a common factor (e.g. migration) simultaneously affecting both traits, and/or protein limitation forcing allocation decisions. We used diet manipulations to generate within-individual variation in gizzard mass and test for independence between gizzard and pectoral muscle mass within individuals outside the period of migration and under conditions of high protein availability. Contrary to our prediction, we observed a negative within-individual covariation between gizzard and pectoral muscle mass. We discuss this result as a potential outcome of an evolved mechanism underlying body remodelling associated with migration. Although our proposed mechanism requires empirical testing, this study echoes earlier calls for greater integration of studies of function and mechanism, and in particular, the need for more explicit consideration of the evolution of mechanisms underlying phenotypic design.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noise is an environmental factor that has been associated with metabolic and sleep disorders. Sleep is a vital function, since it underpins physiologic processes and cognitive recovery and development. However, the effects of chronic noise exposure on the developing organism are still subject to debate. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of suhchronic, high-level noise exposure on sleep, apnea, and homeostasis in juvenile rats. METHODS: Twenty-four 3-Wk-old male Wistar rats were exposed to noise [87.5 decibels (dB), 50-20,000 Hz for 5 wk and 2 d during the 12-h rest period. Data on sleep stages, food and water intake, apnea, and body and organ weight were recorded. RESULTS: Five weeks of high-level noise exposure were associated with hypeiphagia (+15\%), body weight gain (+6\%), a heavier thymus (+26\%), and heavier adrenal glands (+117\%). A sleep analysis highlighted microstructural differences in the active period: in particular, the mean daily amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep as a proportion of total sleep time (TST) was higher. The mean daily amount of non-REM (NREM) sleep was lower in the exposed group, meaning that the intergroup difference in the TST was not significant. During a 1-h, noise-free plethysmographic recording during the rest period, the mean total amount of active wakefulness (AW) was lower in the exposed group (by 9.1 min), whereas the mean duration of an episode of REM sleep was higher (by 1.8 min), and the TST was higher (by 10.7 min). DISCUSSION: Subchronic exposure of juvenile rats to high-intensity noise during the rest period was associated with some small but significant sleep disturbances, greater food and water intakes, greater body weight gain, and greater thymus and adrenal gland weights. The main effects of noise exposure on sleep were also observed in the 1-h plethysmography session after 5 wk of exposure.},

Sexual differences in reproductive investment, territoriality and resource use may result in sexual dimorphism on body size and other morphological traits. These life-history components are key for understanding the selective forces underlying male and female reproductive strategies in a population. We investigated the reproductive biology of the stream-breeding frog Crossodactylus schmidti through the histological analysis of testes, ovaries, and bone samples. Mature males and females and free-swimming tadpoles occurred in all months, though the monthly proportion of mature females was variable. Free spermatozoa, sperm bundles, and germ cell cysts in several stages occurred in testes of all except two males, whilst ovaries of most females presented all follicle stages, indicating continuous gametogenesis in both sexes. There was no significant seasonal variation in snout-vent length (SVL), body mass (BM) or in the gonadosomatic index for neither sex, further indicating a continuous pattern of reproduction. Minimum SVL and age at sexual maturity was 22.14 mm and 2 a, respectively, in males, and 21.78 mm and 3 a, respectively, in females; both sexes reached up to six years of longevity. Gonad mass increased with BM in both sexes, though this effect was much stronger in females. After controlling for age, females were significantly larger than males in SVL, BM, and MW (mouth width): the larger female body size suggests selection for increased fecundity, whereas the larger MW possibly favors the consumption of large, energetically important prey for sustaining the continuous egg production. Finally, there was a positive correlation between female SVL and number of thumb spines, but the number of thumb spines did not differ between the sexes; we briefly discuss a possible role of thumb spines in the courtship of C. schmidti based on field observations.},

We measured visceral organ masses in hatchling alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) from five clutches from approximately 45 to 500 g wet body mass. The interaction between initial egg mass and clutch identity was significant for initial hatchling mass, but only egg mass, not clutch, had a significant effect on initial snout-vent and head length. Kidney and liver mass showed biphasic scaling with body mass, as determined by “breakpoint” analyses, with the breakpoint at 120 g wet body mass. Kidney and liver wet mass showed slopes b {\textgreater} 1.0 as animals increased approximately 45-120 g, with significantly lower b approximately 0.8-0.9 for alligators 120-500 g. Within kidney and liver mass, below and above the breakpoint, organ mass slopes tended to be similar across clutches. Lung and heart wet mass did not show biphasic scaling, with b approximately 0.8-0.9. Within lung and heart mass, clutches had statistically identical slopes. Combined clutch data for wet mass showed distinct regressions with b {\textgreater} 1.4 for approximately 45-120 g alligators' kidney and liver mass, compared with approximately 120-500 g alligators' kidney, liver, lung, and heart mass b {\textless} 1.0. Alligators show rapid kidney and liver growth following hatching, with higher rates than lung or heart tissue. Clutch, egg mass, and hatchling size influence organ size, and each factor should be accounted for in future studies exploring reptile morphology and physiology to assess environmental versus clutch contributions.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the MSM level in the diet on the growth performance, slaughter performance, breast meat quality and serum biochemical parameters in geese from 22 to 70 days of age. A one-factor completely randomized design was adopted in our study. A total of one thousand eight 21-day-old geese were randomly divided into six groups, with six replicates per group and 28 birds per replicate. The geese were fed diets containing MSM levels of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 g/kg during day 22-70. The dietary MSM level had no effect (p {\textgreater} .05) on the final body weight (BW), average daily gain (ADG) or average daily feed intake (ADFI). The feed/gain ratio (F/G) increased linearly (p {\textless} .001) as the dietary MSM level increased. No differences (p {\textgreater} .05) were observed in the slaughter performance, meat quality and the relative organ weight (except for thymus) of the geese (p {\textgreater} .05). The relative weight of the thymus in the geese fed diets with supplementation of MSM was higher than that in the non-supplemented MSM control group (p {\textless} .05). In addition, 100 g MSM/kg of diet decreased the serum glucose (GLU) level (p {\textless} .05) and increased the alanine transaminase (ALT) enzyme activity (p = .03). Dietary MSM levels of no more than 60 g/kg had no effects on the growth performance and slaughter performance, whereas diets with 100 g MSM/kg increased the F/G and serum ALT enzyme activity, as well as decreasing the serum GLU level. Therefore, MSM provided at a reasonable level could be developed as an unconventional feedstuff for geese at the finisher period.},

Growth performances were measured weekly. One bird per pen was selected and sacrificed to collect blood, ileal digesta, jejunum sample, viscera organ weight, and meat samples on day 21 and 35. Results revealed that birds fed NC+POL+CRL diet had higher (P{\textless} 0.05) body weight, weight gain, and the improved (P{\textless} 0.05) feed efficiency compared to birds fed other low energy diets, and the effect was more prominent at the grower phase from day 21 to 35.

One organ that appears to show great morphological variation is the reptilian kidney found in Crocodylia, Testudines, and Squamata (Sauria and Ophidia). However, limited research has been conducted to evaluate and compare kidney morphology in reptiles and more specifically, in turtles. Here we have examined multiple cryptodiran turtle species from the families Chelydridae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, and Trionychidae. Detailed descriptions of kidney morphology along with comparative allometry are provided. Significant differences in external renal morphology were found between and within turtle families as well as differences in scaling of kidney mass with body mass.

Regardless of its extensive use in agriculture and related fields, these should be properly and thoroughly investigated because of unexplored danger which they bring along. The present investigation deals about the effects of one such pesticide, Permethrin, belonging to the class of synthetic pyrethroids, having broad range application in the field of agriculture, as an insect repellent, in lice shampoos, in the treatment of scabies and numerous other commercial uses. Although few reports have documented its adverse effect on the vital organs in different experimental models, there still persist lacunae in literature about its effect on the male reproductive tissue. Hence, the present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of Permethrin on the male reproductive gonad of Swiss albino mice. Permethrin (130 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally for a period of 21 days after which the biochemical parameters in testis were assayed. The results showed that Permethrin administration lowered the gravimetric indices (body weight p{\textless}0.002, organ weight p{\textless}0.001) and decreased the levels of protein (p{\textless}0.001) and cholesterol (p{\textless}0.001), which is an important precursor in the formation of androgens. Essential enzymes like 3 beta and 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase which are pivotal in the steroidogenesis pathway were also found to be depleted (p{\textless}0.001 and p{\textless}0.002 respectively). These findings were further confirmed by the histopathological analysis and indicated that Permethrin had negative effects on the male reproductive system and can be one of the contributing factors leading to infertility.},

Despite the plethora of traits studied, there is little understanding of the possible impacts domestication has had on internal organs, which are key determinants of survival. Moreover, the genetic basis of observed associated changes in artificial environments is still puzzling. Here we examine impacts of captivity on two organs in Atlantic salmon (Salar salar) that have been domesticated for approximately 50 years: heart and liver, in addition to growth. We studied multiple families of wild, domesticated, F-1 and F-2 hybrid, and backcrossed strains of S. salar in replicated common garden tanks during the freshwater and marine stages of development. Heart and liver weight were investigated, along with heart morphology metrics examined in just the wild, domesticated and F-1 hybrid strains (heart height and width). Growth was positively linked with the proportion of the domesticated strain, and recombination in F-2 hybrids (and the potential disruption of co-adapted gene complexes) did not influence growth. Despite the influence of domestication on growth, we found no evidence for domestication-driven divergence in heart or liver morphology. However, sexual dimorphism was detected in heart morphology, and after controlling for body size, females exhibited significantly larger heart weight and heart width when compared with males. Wild females also had an increased heart height when compared with wild males, and this was not observed in any other strain. Females sampled in saltwater showed significantly larger heart height with rounder hearts, than saltwater males. Collectively, these results demonstrate an additive basis of growth and, despite a strong influence of domestication on growth, no clear evidence of changes in heart or liver morphology associated with domestication was identified.},

	abstract = {The present study was investigated the effects of dietary Achyranthes japonica extract (AJE) supplementation on the growth performance, total tract digestibility, cecal microflora, excreta noxious gas emission, breast meat quality, and organ weight in broiler chickens. In total, 640 Ross x Ross male broiler chickens (1-day-old) were randomly distributed into 4 dietary treatments with 10 replicate cages (16 birds/replicate) per treatment group for 5 wk. The dietary treatments included a control basal diet without AJE, and diets with 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1\% AJE. Body weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion improved linearly with the supplementation of AJE over the experimental period (days 1 to 35) (P {\textless} 0.05). Dietary AJE supplementa- tion caused a significant increase in the apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen (linear, P {\textless} 0.05). The cecal Lactobacillus, E. coli, and Salmonella counts were linearly affected with increasing dietary AJE supplementation (P {\textless} 0.05). With increasing levels of AJE, excreta ammonia gas concentration showed a linear decrease (P {\textless} 0.05). The breast muscle weight linearly increased, along with a decrease in the abdominal fat weight, in treatment groups fed with AJE (P {\textless} 0.05). These results indicate that dietary addition with increasing AJE linearly improved growth performance, total tract digestibility, cecal microflora, excreta ammonia gas emission, and abdominal fat weight in broiler chickens.},

	abstract = {Effects of total replacement of soybean meal (SBM) with defatted black soldier fly larvae meal (BSFLM) on egg production and quality, organ weight, and apparent retention (AR) of components were investigated in Shaver White hens from 28 to 43 wk of age. A total of 108 birds, (6 birds/cage) were assigned to three diets (6 replicates/diet). Diets were control corn-SBM diet and two additional diets made with the addition of either 10 or 15\% BSFLM. Diets met or exceeded breeder specifications, contained TiO2 as an indigestible marker, and were prepared in pellet form. Birds had free access to feed and water throughout the experiment. Hen-day egg production (HDEP) was monitored daily. Feed intake (FI) and body weight (BW) were monitored in 4-wk intervals. All eggs laid on the sixth day of wks 31, 35, 39, and 43 were used for egg weight (EW), Haugh units (HU), yolk color (YC), shell breaking strength (SBS), and shell thickness (ST). Excreta samples were collected for 3 consecutive days on wk 33 for AR and two birds/cage were necropsied at the end. There were no (P {\textgreater} 0.05) diet effects on HDEP, FI, and HU. Inclusion of BSFLM linearly decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) egg mass and feed conversion ratio (FCR) and quadratically increased (P {\textless} 0.05) BW. There was no (P {\textgreater} 0.05) interaction between diet and sampling time point on egg quality parameters. Inclusion of BSFLM increased SBF and YC linearly (P {\textless} 0.05) and ST quadratically (P = 0.028). Inclusion of BSFLM quadratically (P {\textless}= 0.01) reduced empty ceca weight and increased liver weight and had no effect (P {\textgreater} 0.05) on gizzard, small intestine, and pancreas weights. Feeding BSFLM linearly (P = 0.001) and quadratically (P = 0.007) increased apparent metabolizable energy (AME). Data showed that defatted BSFLM resulted in deeper orange yolks and improved eggshell quality; however, unfavorable FCR linked to lighter eggs as well as heavier birds and liver warrants further investigations.},

The mixture of A. bilimbi fruit filtrate and shrimp paste were incubated for 4 days and were then used in the experiment. For in vivo experiment, 40 day-old Lohmann broiler chicks were distributed randomly to two treatment groups, i.e., control (T1) and chickens given the mixture of 10\% A. bilimbi fruit filtrate and shrimp paste in drinking water (T2). Body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly. At day 42, 2 birds from each pen (8 chicks per treatment group) were taken for blood and digesta collection. Internal organ weight and carcass traits were determined thereafter. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was lower (P{\textless}0.05) on the treatment group than the control. Hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of the treatment group were higher (P{\textless}0.05) than that of the control. Total cholesterol was higher (P{\textless}0.05) in the treatment group than that in control. Total cecum coliform was lower (P{\textless}0.05) in the treatment group than that in the control.

Hanpen is known as a high-protein and low-fat food. However, there is a lack of evidence on its health benefits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hanpen intake on organ weight and biomarker levels in Sprague-Dawley rats with diets consisting of hanpen for 84 days as an initial study. Male, 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: group I, fed normal diets, and group II, fed normal diets with 5\% dried hanpen. Throughout the 84-day treatment period, we checked body weight and food intake, and after 84 days, we performed organ weight and blood biochemical analyses. No significant differences were seen in body weight, food intake, organ weight, and most biochemical parameters between group I and group II. Interestingly, total cholesterol (T-CHO) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels of group II were significantly higher than those of group I after administration for 84 days. Moreover, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of group II was marked lower than that of group I, and other liver function parameters of group II tended to be lower than those of group I. As conclusion, “Hanpen,” a Japanese traditional food, could be effective as a functional food for human health management worldwide.},

	abstract = {Star anise (Illicium verum Hook. f) has been used as spice and herbal medicine for many years with lacking researches on evaluating its application for improving relative organ weight, intestinal development, and quality of animal products. The experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of star anise, its essential oil and leavings on carcass traits, relative organ weight, intestinal development, and meat quality of broiler chickens. A total of 384 broilers were randomly assigned to 4 treatments with 8 replicates of 12 birds each. The 4 dietary treatments were basal diet (Control), basal diet supplemented with 5 g/kg star anise (Star anise), basal diet supplemented with 0.22 g/kg essential oil (Essential oil), and basal diet supplemented with 5 g/kg leavings (Leavings). The concentration of main active components in the experimental diets was 0.204 g transanethole/kg of diet. All birds were fed a starter diet (0-21 d) and a grower diet (22-42 d). Birds supplemented with star anise and essential oil had a greater (P{\textless}0.05) final body weight (BW) than control birds and those supplemented with leavings. However, the carcass yield, half chamber rate, eviscerated rate, and percentages of breast muscle and thigh muscle in birds were similar (P{\textgreater}0.05) among all treatments. Birds supplemented with star anise and essential oil had higher (P = 0.010) relative weight of thymus than those in control and leavings groups. Essential oil supplemented groups appeared to contain the highest (P{\textless}0.05) villus height in ileum and villus height/crypt depth ratio in ileum and jejunum among all the groups. Meanwhile, among all the groups, breast muscles of essential oil-supplemented groups appeared to contain the lowest (P = 0.012) boiling loss but highest (P{\textless}0.001) concentration of inosinic acid (inosine 50-monophosphate, IMP). In conclusion, dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg star anise and 0.22 g/kg essential oil improved BW, relative organ weight, and intestinal development, and 0.22 g/kg essential oil can also increase the concentration of IMP but decrease the boiling loss in breast muscles of broilers; however, 5 g/kg leavings had no effect.},

	abstract = {Background: Echinops kebericho is widely used for treatment of a variety of diseases including infectious, non-infectious disease and fumigation during child birth. Antibacterial, antimalarial, anti-leshimania, anti-diarrheal and insect repellent activities have been elucidated. Its toxicity profile is not yet investigated and thus this study was to investigate acute and sub-acute toxicity of E. kebericho decoctions. Methods: Acute toxicity study was performed in female Wistar albino rats with single oral dose and followed up to 14 days. The sub-acute oral dose toxicity studies were conducted in rats of both sexes in accordance with the repeated dose 28-day oral toxicity study in rodent OECD guidelines. Physical observations were made regularly during the study period while body weight was measured weekly. Organ weight, histopathology, clinical chemistry and hematology data were collected on the 29th day. Results were presented as mean +/- standard deviation. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed if assumptions were met; otherwise Kruskal-Wallis analysis was performed. Result: Oral administration of E. kebericho decoction showed no treatment-related mortality in female rats up to the dose of 5000mg/kg. In sub-acute toxicity studies, no significant treatment-related abnormalities were observed compared to negative controls. Food consumption, body weight, organ weight, hematology, clinical chemistry, and histopathology did not show significant variation between controls and treatment groups. However, creatinine, relative lung weight, triglycerides, and monocytes were lower in treated compared to control groups. Significant variations between male and female groups in food consumption, relative organ weight, hematology, clinical chemistry were observed. Histolo-pathology of high-dose treated groups showed fatty liver. Conclusion: Echinops kebericho showed LD50 of greater than 5000 mg/kg in acute toxicity study and is well tolerated up to the dose of 600 mg/kg body weight in sub-acute toxicity study.},

	abstract = {Swine models had been popular in paediatric oesophageal surgery in the past. Although being largely replaced by rodent models, swine experienced a revival with the establishment of minipig models. However, none of them has ever been investigated for similarity to humans. We conducted a pilot study to determine whether three-week old Pietrain piglets and three-month old Aachen Minipigs are suitable for experimental paediatric oesophageal atresia surgery. We tested the operation's feasibility, performed a necropsy, weighed organs, measured organ length and calculated relative weights and lengths, and measured laboratory parameters. We used multidimensional scaling to assess the similarity of the swine breeds with previously published human data. Pietrain piglets had a higher a priori bodyweight than Aachen Minipigs ( 1/4 1.31 kg, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-2.23, p 1/4 0.015), while snout-to-tail length was similar. Pietrain piglets had higher absolute and relative oesophageal lengths ( 1/4 5.43 cm, 95\% CI: 2.2-8.6; p 1/4 0.0062, q 1 1/4 0.0083 and 1/4 11.4\%, 95\% CI: 5.1-17.6; p 1/4 0.0025, q 3 1/4 0.0053). Likewise, absolute and relative small intestinal lengths were higher in Pietrains, but all other parameters did not differ, with the exception of minor differences in laboratory parameters. Multidimensional scaling revealed three-week old Pietrain piglets to be similar to two-month old humans based on their thoracoabdominal organ weights. This result indicates three-week old Pietrain piglets are a suitable model of paediatric oesophageal atresia surgery, because clinically many procedures are performed at around eight weeks age. Three-month old Aachen Minipigs were more dissimilar to eight-week old humans than three-week old Pietrain piglets.},

	doi = {10.3390/molecules25112662},
	abstract = {Perilla oil has been considered to have excellent potential for treating various diseases due to its contents of beneficial fatty acids, such as alpha -linolenic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid. The therapeutic effects and molecular mechanism of an alpha -linolenic acid-enriched cold-pressed perilla oil (LEP) on hepatic steatosis of an obesity model were investigated by analyzing alterations in fat accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated autophagy, in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity C57BL/6N mice treated with LEP for 16 weeks. Although no significant alterations were detected in body weight and most organ weights, the liver weight and accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver section were significantly lower in HFD + LEP treated group as compared to the HFD + Vehicle treated group. Reduced mRNA expression levels of adipogenesis and lipogenesis regulating factors, including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)(gamma), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha, fatty acid synthase (FAS), and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein 2 (aP2) were observed after LEP treatment for 16 weeks, while the levels of lipolysis were remarkably increased in the same group. Moreover, the LEP-treated groups showed suppression of ER stress-regulating factors, such as the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2 alpha), inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1)alpha, and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) during anti-hepatic steatosis effects. The expression level of the microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) protein and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway for the autophagy response showed a significant decrease in the HFD+LEP-treated group. Furthermore, ER stress-mediated autophagy was accompanied with enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), JNK, and p38 protein in the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that treatment with LEP inhibits hepatic steatosis in the HFD-induced obese model through regulation of adipogenesis and lipolysis. We believe our results are the first to show that the anti-hepatic steatosis activity of alpha -linolenic acid from cold-pressed perilla oil might be tightly correlated with the amelioration of ER stress-mediated autophagy.},

	abstract = {Toxic effects among fumonisins B (FB), deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEN) administered alone and combined were investigated in 84-day-old ducks during force-feeding. 75 male ducks, divided into five groups of 15 animals, received daily during the meal a capsule containing the desired among of toxin. Treated animals received dietary levels of toxins equivalent to 20 mg FB1+FB2/kg (FB), 5 mg DON/kg (DON), 0.5 mg ZEN/kg (ZEN) and 20, 5 and 0.5 mg/kg of FB, DON and ZEN (FBDONZEN), respectively. Control birds received capsules with no toxin. After 12 days, a decrease in body weight gain accompanied by an increase in the feed conversion ratio was observed in ducks exposed to FBDONZEN, whereas there was no effect on performances in ducks exposed to FB, DON and ZEN separately. No difference among groups was observed in relative organ weight, biochemistry, histopathology and several variables used to measure oxidative damage and testicular function. A sphinganine to sphingosine ratio of 0.32, 1.19 and 1.04, was measured in liver in controls and in ducks exposed to FB and FBDONZEN, respectively. Concentrations of FB1 in liver were 13.34 and 15.4 ng/g in ducks exposed to FB and FBDONZEN, respectively. Together ZEN and its metabolites were measured after enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated forms. Mean concentrations of alpha-zearalenol in liver were 0.82 and 0.54 ng/g in ducks exposed to ZEN and FBDONZEN, respectively. beta-zearalenol was 2.3-fold less abundant than alpha-zearalenol, whereas ZEN was only found in trace amounts. In conclusion, this study suggests that decreased performance may occur in ducks exposed to a combination of FB, DON and ZEN, but does not reveal any other interaction between mycotoxins in any of the other variables measured.},

	abstract = {Effects of fiber source with various particle size and carbohydrase enzyme on growth criteria, carcass and blood characteristics, digestive enzyme activity, cecal microbial population and ileal morphology of chukar partridge were evaluated for a total period of 90 days. 300 day-old partridge were randomly allotted to a 5 \& times; 2 factorial arrangement with 4 different fiber inclusion with different mean particle size (MPS) (none; rice hulls (RH) (711 +/- 1.8 mu m); wheat straw (WS) Coarse (3211 +/- 1.2 mu m); wheat straw Fine (755 +/- 1.9 mu m); and wheat bran (WB) (767 +/- 1.8 mu m)) along with a low-fiber control diets and two levels of carbohydrase enzyme (0 or 50 mg/kg). There were 10 treatments and 5 pens with 6 partridge chicks per each treatment. The results indicated that fiber inclusion regardless of fiber source significantly increased body weight (BW) of birds during the whole experimental period (P {\textless} 0.01). Among the fiber sources, the highest BW attained when fine WS and WB was incorporated into the low fiber diet (P {\textless} 0.01). The effect of enzyme on body weight was significant on days 60 and 90. Moreover, there were interactive effects (P{\textless} 0.01) between fiber sources and enzyme on BW during the trial. Feed intake significantly (P{\textless} 0.001) increased at starter (30 days) phase of trial by inclusion of fiber to control diet, but no significant differences were noted after on days 60 and 90. Enzyme addition had no effect on feed intake and also no interactive effect was observed between fiber source and enzyme for feed intake. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was reduced by inclusion of fiber into control low fiber diet especially at late stage of rearing period (P{\textless} 0.05). Plasma uric acid concentration was reduced by inclusion of fiber on day 28 (P{\textless} 0.05). Inclusion of fine WS increased plasma triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) concentration on day 90 (P{\textless} 0.05). There were interactive effects (P{\textless} 0.05) between fiber sources and enzyme on total cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) cholesterol on day 90. Jejunum and ileum relative weight were reduced by inclusion of fiber to control diet and the effect was more pronounced for coarse wheat straw (P{\textless} 0.05). Duodenum and ileum weight were increased by addition of enzyme to diets (P{\textless} 0.05). Fiber inclusion regardless of fiber source and particle size significantly (P{\textless} 0.01) reduced duodenum, jejunum and ileum relative length. Addition of coarse WS and RH into the low fiber diet significantly increased alkaline protease, trypsin and alpha-amylase activity (P{\textless} 0.01). There were interactive effects (P{\textless} 0.05) between fiber sources and enzyme on digestive enzyme activity (P{\textless} 0.01). Enzyme addition reduced trypsin activity (P{\textless} 0.05). Ceca E. coli population was increased when fiber sources were incorporated into the low fiber diet (P{\textless} 0.05). Villi length, crypt depth and villi to crypt ratio were reduced (P{\textless} 0.01) considerably regardless of fiber source compared to the low fiber diet. Inclusion of coarse WS increased and RH reduced (P{\textless} 0.01) submucosa, lamina propria and epithelial cells layer thickness compared to the low fiber diet. The results confirmed that partridge growth perfor-mance was improved by inclusion of fiber. Results obtained from current trial suggest that the fiber is a very important part of partridge diets which could improve the performance with advancing age especially in long-lived partridge.},

	abstract = {The fish paste product, fish balls `tsumire', is a traditional type of Japanese food made from minced fish as well as imitation crab, kamaboko and hanpen. Although tsumire is known as a high-protein and low-fat food, there is a lack of scientific evidence on its health benefits. Hence, we aimed to investigate the effects of tsumire intake on organ weight and biomarker levels in Sprague-Dawley rats for 84 d as a preliminary study. Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups: group I, fed normal diets, and group II, fed normal diets with 5 \% dried tsumire. Throughout the administration period, we monitored their body weight and food intake; at the end of this period, we measured their organ weight and analysed their blood biochemistry. No significant differences were observed with respect to body weight, food intake, organ weight and many biochemical parameters between the two groups. It was found that inorganic phosphorus and glucose levels were higher in group II rats than in group I rats. On the other hand, sodium, calcium, amylase and cholinesterase levels were significantly lower in group II than in group I. Interestingly, we found that the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase and leucine aminopeptidase in group II were significantly lower than in group I, and that other liver function parameters of group II tended to be lower than in group I. In conclusion, we consider that the Japanese traditional food, `tsumire,' may be effective as a functional food for human health management worldwide.},

However, whether exogenous or endogenous serine deficiency affects lipid accumulation in the liver and related mechanisms is unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of serine deficiency on hepatic fat accumulation in mice fed a serine-deficient diet or in mice supplemented with the D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) inhibitor NCT-503. Both treatments produced an increase in body weight and liver weight and higher triglyceride content in the liver. Both treatments also exacerbated hepatic inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Importantly, NCT-503 supplementation significantly inhibited PHGDH activity and decreased the serine content in the liver. Dietary serine deficiency significantly affected the colonic microbiota, characterized by a decreased ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and decreased proportion of Bifidobacterium. Dietary serine deficiency additionally resulted in significantly decreased colonic and serum acetate and butyrate levels. The collective results indicate that NCT-503 supplementation may contribute to overaccumulation of hepatic lipid, by causing hepatic serine deficiency, while dietary serine deficiency may produce similar outcomes by affecting the gut-microbiota-liver axis. © 2021 Liuqin He et al.},

	abstract = {Early postnatal lung development (1–25 days) in the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) was investigated to assess the morphofunctional status of one of the most immature marsupial neonates. Lung volume, surface density, surface area, and parenchymal and nonparenchymal volume proportions were determined using light microscopic morphometry. The lungs of the neonate were at the canalicular stage and consisted of two “balloon-like” airways with few septal ridges. The absolute volume of the lung was only 0.0009 cm3 with an air space surface density of 108.83 cm−1 and a surface area of 0.082 cm2. The increase in lung volume in the first three postnatal days was mainly due to airspace expansion. The rapid postnatal development of the lung was indicated by an increase in the septal proportion of the parenchyma around day 4, which was reflected by an increase in the airspace surface density and surface area. By day 5, the lung entered the saccular stage of development with a reduction in septal thickness, expansion of the tubules into saccules and development of a double capillary system. The subsequent saccular period was characterized by repetitive septation steps, which increased the number of airway generations. The lungs of the newborn Dasyurus viverrinus must be considered as structurally and quantitatively insufficient to meet the respiratory requirements at birth. Hence, cutaneous gas exchange might be crucial for the first three postnatal days. The lung has to mature rapidly in the early postnatal period to support the increased metabolic requirements of the developing young. © 2021 The Author.

Oreochromis niloticus were bred in individual and group cultures. The scaling exponent of the RMR in the individual cultures was b = 0.620-0.821 (n = 30) and that in the group culture was b = 0.770 [natural logarithm (ln) RMR = 0.770 ln M - 1.107 (n = 76)]. The results of the two experimental methods were similar and were not significantly different from 0.75 (3/4), as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology. The active and inactive organs were scaled with body mass by an exponent of 0.940 and 1.012, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the blood parameters and body mass. These results suggest that the differences in the culture methods may not have affected the allometric scaling of O. niloticus metabolism. The proportion of active and inactive organs contributed to allometric changes in the metabolic rate with body mass. Red blood cells in fish are not generally representative, and cell size can only partially explain the allometric scaling of metabolism.},

	abstract = {Digestive tract measurements are often considered species specific, but little information exists on the degree to which they change during ontogeny within a species. Additionally, access to anatomical material from nondomestic species is often limited, with fixed tissues possibly representing the only available source, though the degree to which this material is representative in terms of dimensions and weight is debatable. In the present study, the macroscopic anatomy of the digestive tract (length of intestinal sections, and tissue weights of stomach and intestines) of 58 Lemur catta [ranging in age from 1 month (neonates) to 25 years], which had been stored frozen (n = 27) or fixed in formalin (n = 31), was quantified. Particular attention was paid to the caecum and the possible presence of an appendix. The intraspecific allometric scaling of body mass (BM)(0.46[0.40;0.51]) for total intestine length and BM0.48[0.41;0.54] for small intestine length was higher than the expected geometric scaling of BM0.33, and similar to that reported in the literature for interspecific scaling. This difference in scaling is usually explained by the hypothesis that, to maintain optimal absorption, the diameter of the intestinal tube cannot increase geometrically. Therefore, geometric volume gain of increasing body mass is accommodated for by more-than-geometric length scaling. According to the literature, not all L. catta have an appendix. No appendix was found in the specimens in the present study. The proportions of length measurements did not change markedly during ontogeny, indicating that the proportions of the foetus are representative of those of the adult animal. By contrast, width and tissue-mass scaling of the caecum indicated disproportionate growth of this organ during ontogeny that was not reflected in its length. Compared to overall intraspecific variation, the method of storage (frozen vs. formalin) had no relevant impact on length or weight measurements.},

	abstract = {In the aquaculture industry, fish oil is widely used as a nutritional supplement to promote the gonadal maturation of broodstocks, while the mechanism of fish oil on ovary development remain unclear. Herein, female adult spotted scat (Scatophagus argus) with most ovaries at phase II were fed with diets containing 8\% soybean oil (SO) or 8\% fish oil (FO) for 60 days. The final average fish body weight was similar between FO and SO groups. The average gonadosomatic index (GSI) of FO group was higher (non-significant) than that of SO group. Finally, the phase IV ovary of the FO and SO groups were 7 and 5 out of 10, respectively. The serum estradiol (E2) level of the FO group was significantly higher than that of the SO group. The proportions of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) in the ovaries were much higher in the FO group than in the SO group. These results suggest that the maturity level of the FO group is relatively higher than that of the SO group. Transcriptome sequencing was used to detect the ovary gene expression. Comparatively, the ovary transcriptome analysis showed 68 up-regulated and 193 down-regulated genes in the FO group. The expression levels of Jund and Jun necessary for the ovary maturation were up-regulated in the FO group, while Ppar gamma and Cxcl12, which could inhibit the ovary development, were down-regulated in the FO group. Cyp3a27 coding the enzyme for degrading the estrogen was significantly down-regulated in the FO group and coincided with the increase of its serum E2. Kif5b which could regulate the glucose metabolism was up-regulated in the FO group. Serum insulin level was also increased in the FO group. Additionally, Aldh3a2 and Plin2 related to lipid metabolism were significantly down-regulated in the FO group. Briefly, dietary fish oil can influence the expression of genes related to steroid hormone, glucose and lipid metabolism. This study will clarify the mechanism of dietary fish oil in promoting ovary development in teleost fish.},

Therefore, the effects of feeding sources of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) from hatch through to 22 weeks of age (woa) on growth, organ weight, and jejunal histomorphology were investigated. A total of 588-day-old Ross x Ross 708 BB were reared on one of 3 diets: 1) control, corn-soybean meal diet, 2) Control + 1\% microalgae (DMA, Aurantichytrium limacinum), as a source of DHA and 3) Control + 2.50\% co-extruded full fat flaxseed and pulse mixture (FFF, 1:1 wt/wt), as a source of ALA. Diets DMA and FFF had similar total n-3 and n-6: n-3 ratio. Diets were allocated to floor pens (28 birds/pen) to give 9 or 6 replicates per diet for control or DMA and FFF, respectively and fed according to breeder curve in 3 phases: starter (0-4 woa), grower (5-19 woa), and pre-breeder (20-22 woa). Individual body weight (BW) was taken weekly and 6 birds/pen necropsied at 5 and 12 woa for gastrointestinal, spleen, bursa, and liver weight and samples for jejunal histomorphology. There was no (P {\textgreater} 0.05) diet effect on growth by 20 woa. With exception of 5 woa, pullets fed DMA showed (P {\textless} 0.001) lower BW coefficient of variation (C.V.) than pullets fed control between 2 and 7 woa. However, pullets fed DMA had higher BW CV at 20 woa than birds fed either control or FFF. At 5 woa, birds fed DMA had taller (P {\textless}= 0.01) villi and deeper crypt than birds fed either control or FFF but VH or CD were similar (P {\textgreater} 0.05) between CON and FFF pullets. At 12 woa, birds fed FFF had taller VH than birds fed control diet but similar (P {\textgreater} 0.05) to that of birds fed DMA. Therefore, different responses to sources of omega-3 FA may implicate other components, however, the BW uniformity and intestinal histomorphology responses suggested benefits of feeding omega-3 FA during rearing.},

After two lunar cycles, findings revealed a significant reduction in bodyweight and absolute organ weight of liver and spleen and haemoglobin in intoxicated groups as compared to control. Haematological attributes showed no significant change. Serum glucose showed a significant reduction in intoxicated groups whereas cholesterol, serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen showed a significant increase in ethion treated groups as compared to control. Cholinesterase showed significant inhibition in ethion-treated groups. Histopathological studies revealed serous inflammation in group II and moderate to severe degeneration and cellular infiltration in group III and IV, respectively.

To assess the confounding effects of ABT in such kind of mechanistic studies, a repeated dose toxicity study with ABT following 7 days oral administration at 0, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day was performed in Wistar rats (5 rats/sex/group). Wistar rat is selected as a model being one of the well characterized rodent species, widely used for toxicity and toxicokinetics studies. The standard parameters of general toxicity study viz. clinical signs, body weight, feed consumption, clinical, gross and histopathology were evaluated. The ABT was tolerated up to the highest tested dose of 100 mg/kg/day. No clinical signs, mortality or effect on feed consumption at any dose. Slight increase in body weight gain was noted in ABT treated females. Increased reticulocyte, and decreased triglycerides, BUN, A/G ratio and plasma potassium; increased weight of liver, kidneys, adrenals and thyroid was noted in ABT treated animals. Microscopically, hypertrophic findings were noted in liver, thyroid, adrenal glands, pituitary and uterus. Some of these changes were observed at as low as 25 mg/kg/day, therefore, NOEL could not be established. Based on this study, it is concluded that ABT is tolerable up to 100 mg/kg/day with some variations in clinical pathology, organ weight and histopathology; these changes should be considered during the assessment of any mechanistic study with ABT. Findings of this manuscript were presented at 58th meeting of the Society of Toxicology, Baltimore, 11 March 2019.},

	abstract = {Objective: Quail production is ranked as an important alternative animal protein source in Cameroon. One of the main constraints of this production is the quality of feed, which lacks protein that is regularly supplied by fish meal. To avoid disagreements due to the constant shortage of fish meal, alternative protein sources are needed, and among them are crickets (Acheta domesticus). The goal of this study was to find out how well Japanese quails could be raised if fish meal was replaced with cricket meal. Materials and Methods: A total of 192, 4-week-old quails were divided into 12 similar sets of 8 females and 8 males. The Four experimental diets (T00, T15, T30, and T45) were all formulated based on the level (0\%, 15\%, 30\%, and 45\%, respectively) of fish meal substitution with cricket meal in the basal diet (crude protein: 20.18\% and ME: 3,013.78 kcal/kg) and randomly assigned to three sets in a completely randomized design consisting of four treatments each repeated three times. Growth, carcass, and some reproduction parameters were collected. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and the Duncan test, with a significance level of 5\%. Results: Cricket meal diets increased body weight in males (204.32 +/- 5.69 gm for T45) and regardless of the sex (226.72 +/- 29.45 gm for T30) compared to 184.17 +/- 3.11 gm and 214.55 +/- 32.77 gm for the control group, respectively. In females, substitution at 30\% increased body weight (253.80 +/- 6.48 gm), while 45\% induced a reduction (216.67 +/- 6.49 gm) when compared to the control group value (244.92 +/- 6.07 gm). Carcass yield and the proportion of different parts were not significantly affected by the experimental diets. Liver proportions were significantly higher at 15\% and 35\% cricket meal incorporation compared to 45\%. First songs and egg laying were recorded at 7 weeks with T15, which also led to improved egg laying performance compared to the other treatments. Ovaries were poorly developed in the T45 females compared to the other treatments. Conclusions: Cricket flour might be a good candidate as a locally available protein source to substitute fish meal in the Japanese quail's diet at the finisher and reproductive stages, and the level of 30\% seems to be more efficient.},

	abstract = {Morphogenesis is an emergent property of biochemical and cellular interactions during development. Genome size and the correlated trait of cell size can influence these interactions through effects on developmental rate and tissue geometry, ultimately driving the evolution of morphology. We tested whether variation in genome and body size is related to morphological variation in the heart and liver using nine species of the salamander genus Plethodon (genome sizes 29-67 gigabases). Our results show that overall organ size is a function of body size, whereas tissue structure changes dramatically with evolutionary increases in genome size. In the heart, increased genome size is correlated with a reduction of myocardia in the ventricle, yielding proportionally less force-producing mass and greater intertrabecular space. In the liver, increased genome size is correlated with fewer and larger vascular structures, positioning hepatocytes farther from the circulatory vessels that transport key metabolites. Although these structural changes should have obvious impacts on organ function, their effects on organismal performance and fitness may be negligible because low metabolic rates in salamanders relax selective pressure on function of key metabolic organs. Overall, this study suggests large genome and cell size influence the developmental systems involved in heart and liver morphogenesis.},

The parameters determined were hatchability, body weight (BW), organ weight, hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), and antioxidant-related gene expression. Percent hatchability was calculated on a fertile egg basis. Growth performance was analyzed using each chick as an experimental unit. Eight birds per group were used for organ weight. Two-way ANOVA was used taking temperature and GABA as the main effect for growth performance and gene expression studies. Analysis was performed using an IBM SPSS statistics software package 25.0 (IBM software, Chicago, IL, USA). Hatchability was similar in all the groups and was slightly lower in the T1N1. Higher BW was recorded in both T1 and N1. Intestinal weight and MDA were higher in T0N1 against T0N0 and T1N1, respectively. The expression of HSP70, HSP90, NOX1, and NOX4 genes was higher and SOD and CAT genes were lower in the T1 group. The present results show that T1 and N1 independently improve the BW of broiler chicks at hatch, but T1 strongly regulates stress-related gene expression and suggests that both T1 and N1 during incubation can improve performance and alleviate stress after hatch.},

For the first time, we document its host range in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), the prevalence and intensity of infections on wild hosts, and its impacts on host morphology and performance. Infections were observed on four benthic gobies in the BVI (Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, C. venezuelae, C. dicrus and C. eidolon) but not on other host species previously reported from other parts of the western Atlantic. Infected gobies were widespread in the BVI (detected at 33 of 52 sites, prevalence from 1-25\%) but extremely rare elsewhere in the Caribbean (detected at 2 of 16 sites, prevalence {\textless} 0.006\%). As is typical of macroparasite infections, P. tortugensis was over-dispersed in BVI host populations (mean intensity = 4.7, range = 1-17). Infections were most common in juvenile and female hosts, and rarely found in larger male hosts. The copepods attach in the branchial chamber of the goby; female copepods show high attachment fidelity to the ventral surface of the chamber, while male copepods attached most often to the first two gill arches and in the branchial chamber adjacent to the female. Infections caused substantial damage to the host's branchial chamber and gill filaments. Parasitized gobies also had larger livers and smaller gonads than unparasitized individuals of similar length. The changes in organ mass of infected gobies were not sizeable enough to affect total body mass, and host condition (the body-length vs. body-mass relationship) was similar for gobies with and without infections. Parasitized gobies were, however, significantly smaller in body mass at a given age, reflecting slower overall growth. Effects of P. tortugensis on individual hosts were broadly similar to those of other parasitic copepods that infect fish gills and, for unknown reasons, the BVI appears to be a persistent hotspot of infections on these goby hosts.},

	abstract = {Shrews occupy the lower extreme of the seven orders of magnitude mammals range in size. Their hearts are large relative to body weight and heart rate can exceed a thousand beats a minute. It is not known whether traits typical of mammal hearts scale to these extremes. We assessed the heart of three species of shrew (genus Sorex) following the sequential segmental analysis developed for human hearts. Using micro-computed tomography, we describe the overall structure and find, in agreement with previous studies, a large and elongate ventricle. The atrial and ventricular septums and the atrioventricular (AV) and arterial valves are typically mammalian. The ventricular walls comprise mostly compact myocardium and especially the right ventricle has few trabeculations on the luminal side. A developmental process of compaction is thought to reduce trabeculations in mammals, but in embryonic shrews the volume of trabeculations increase for every gestational stage, only slower than the compact volume. By expression of Hcn4, we identify a sinus node and an AV conduction axis which is continuous with the ventricular septal crest. Outstanding traits include pulmonary venous sleeve myocardium that reaches farther into the lungs than in any other mammals. Typical proportions of coronary arteries-to-aorta do not scale and the shrew coronary arteries are proportionally enormous, presumably to avoid the high resistance to blood flow of narrow vessels. In conclusion, most cardiac traits do scale to the miniscule shrews. The shrew heart, nevertheless, stands out by its relative size, elongation, proportionally large coronary vessels, and extent of pulmonary venous myocardium.},

Broiler chickens were reared on one of 3 gut health management programs: 1) conventional (CON), 2) raised without medically important antimi-crobials (RWMIA), and 3) raised without antibiotics (RWA). Studies showed no statistical differences for d 28 body weight, relative spleen weight, or villus height. Both studies showed lower relative liver weight in birds reared on the CON program compared to the other pro-grams (P {\textless}= 0.04). A greater crypt depth (CD) and a lower villus height to crypt depth ratio (VH:CD) was observed in RWA compared to CON under research settings (study 2). Gut health management program influenced ceca SCFA concentration on d 28 under research set-tings with CON birds exhibiting higher concentration of acetic, propionic, butyric, and total SCFA than birds reared on the RWA program. Results suggest that broiler chickens reared on conventional and alternative gut health management programs showed some differences in organ weight, intestinal morphology, and cecal SCFA profile.},

Colobines are classified as tripartite or quadripartite based on the number of compartments in their stomach. To expand our understanding of their morphophysiological digestive characteristics, we attempted to visualize their stomach using photographs, examine the ontogenetic development of gastrointestinal size, and evaluate the interspecific differences in gastrointestinal size relative to the body size with a special reference to differences in stomach types. Materials and Methods Gastrointestinal tracts were dissected from 144 deceased colobine specimens in the Japan Monkey Centre stored in formalin. We measured the gastrointestinal tracts of nine species with a tripartite stomach and two species with a quadripartite stomach. We used an allometric linear regression model to establish how body mass was related to stomach weights and all intestine lengths. Results and discussion Our results support previous findings about primate and colobine macroscopic digestive tracts. In particular, we document the small size of the openings connecting stomach compartments and found that it may be difficult to differentiate between a bulging haustrated pouch and a real praesaccus. The stomach mass analyses indicated hyperallometric stomach growth in colobine infants as opposed to isometric scaling in juvenile specimens and hypoallometric scaling in mature specimens, which is similar to findings in other foregut fermenters. Stomach weight was greater in species with quadripartite stomachs than in species with tripartite stomachs, which suggests that species with a quadripartite stomach possibly have a larger stomach capacity, supporting the concept of their evolutionary adaptation to folivory.},

Thirty-two healthy hens were examined by cloacal swab samples to be free of Salmonella. Then they were weighed individually and distributed to 4 experimental groups containing 8 hens each, including Full-fed (control, FF); total feed withdrawal (positive control for molt induction, FW); 80\% corn silage (CS) + 20\% layer diet (CS80), and 80\% alfalfa meal (AM) + 20\% layer diet (AM80). The molting program was initiated at 71 wk of age. On d 4 of the experiment, all hens were inoculated with SE by oral gavage. All hens were first weighed at the ending molting period on d 10 and then euthanized by CO2 gas. The internal organs including the ovary, oviduct, liver, and spleen, were excised aseptically and weighed. Cloacal swab and feed samples at the beginning and organ sam-ples (liver, ovary, spleen, and cecum) were collected from each hen at the end of the experiment and examined for SE colonies. Molted birds lost roughly 14 to 27\%t of their body weight and had significantly lower organ weight and egg production compared to FF group (P {\textless} 0.05). No significant difference was observed in the number of days to zero egg production between molted treatments. The SE positive organs did not significantly differ between CS80 and AM80 with FF treatment. Treatment CS80 had the lowest crop pH and differed substantially from treatment FW. In conclusion, results indicate that using corn silage and alfalfa meal, can improve resistance to sal-monella Enteritidis during molt inducing compared to traditional feed withdrawal.},

Currently, there is extensive use of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) in pathology and toxicology research. The purpose of this study was to define reference values for absolute and percentage organ weights in M fascicularis of different ages and sex. Organ weights were obtained from necropsies of 1022 cynomolgus monkeys at the Wake Forest School of Medicine from 1997 to 2018. Distributions of absolute and percentage weights for each organ were described; sex and age groups were compared using analysis of variance. Age effects on percentage of body weights for each organ were analyzed within each sex. Diet effects were also analyzed. This evaluation showed that male body weights and absolute organ weights were greater for all age groups; however, female organ to body weight percentages were greater for most organs. Percentage of organ weight to body weight declined for the adrenals, brain, lung, thyroid and thymus during maturation, whereas percentage weight of pancreas, prostate, testes, and uterus increased. Animals consuming a high-fat, Western-type diet had a lower body weight than animals consuming a carbohydrate-rich chow diet. This information will be useful for further toxicology and pathology studies concerning cynomolgus monkeys.},

The present study was designed to investigate the toxicopathological changes induced by aflatoxins and mitigative potential of Lactobacillus plantarum in broiler birds. One hundred and eighty broiler chicks at one day of age was procured from the local market, and chicks were equally divided into six groups with thirty birds in each group. These birds were treated with aflatoxins (300 and 600 mu g/kg) and Lactobacillus plantarum (1 x 10(8) cfu/kg of feed) in different combinations. The first group was kept as the control, and only a basal diet was provided to birds (BD). In the second group (AF1), the first level of aflatoxins (300 mu g/kg) was fed to the birds. In the third group (AF2), the second level of aflatoxins (600 mu g/kg) was fed to birds. In the fourth group (AF1LP), Lactobacillus plantarum was given with first level of aflatoxins. In the fifth group (AF2LP), Lactobacillus plantarum was given with the second level of aflatoxins, and in the 6th group (BDLP), Lactobacillus plantarum alone was fed to the chicks. This experimental study was continued for 42 days. Birds were slaughtered after 42 days, and different parameters were assessed. Parameters studied were gain in body weight, organ weight along with some histopathological, hematological, biochemical parameters and residues of aflatoxins in liver and kidney. Lactobacillus plantarum improved the body weight gain and restored the relative organ weight. Hepatic and renal biomarkers returned to normal concentrations, serum proteins were restored in combination group AF1LP, and partial amelioration was observed in the AF2LP group. Red blood cells, white blood cells, hemoglobin centration and packed cell volume became normalized in the AF1LP group, while partial amelioration was observed in the AF2LP group. LP also reduced the concentration of aflatoxin residues in liver kidney and improved the TAC concentrations. The results of this study elucidated the mitigative potential of Lactobacillus plantarum against serum biochemical, histopathological, hematological and toxicopathological changes induced by aflatoxins in the chicks.},

This study investigated the influence of dietary supplementation of Solanum aethiopicum and Solanecio biafrae leaves, which have nutraceutical properties, on stress response, cytokine expression, antioxidant status, blood chemistry, abdominal fat and meat quality in broilers reared in a hot, dry environment. 2. One day old, Ross 308 chicks (n = 350) were randomly allotted to basal diets containing either no supplement (D1); 2.5 g/kg Solanum aethiopicum leaf (SAL; D2); 5 g/kg SAL (D3); 2.5 g/kg Solanecio biafrae leaf (SBL; D4); or 5 g/kg SBL (D5) for 42 d. Birds were reared at 34 +/- 2 degrees C and 40-50\% relative humidity for 6 h/d from 22-42 d. Each dietary group was replicated in seven pens containing 10 chicks. 3. In the period 1-21 d, body weight gain, feed efficiency and feed intake were not influenced by diet. At 22-42 and 1-42 d, birds supplemented with SAL and SBL had higher (P {\textless} 0.05) body weight gain and feed efficiency than the D1 birds. Cloaca temperature, carcase cuts and relative organ weight did not differ between diets. The D3 birds had higher (P {\textless} 0.05) erythrocytes and haemoglobin compared with other birds. Dietary supplements reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) mortality, abdominal fat, serum total cholesterol, corticosterone, glucose and blood aspartate aminotransferase levels. 4. The treatments up-regulated (P {\textless} 0.05) splenic intelukin-10, and down-regulated (P {\textless} 0.05) tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta genes. A dose-dependent improvement (P {\textless} 0.05) in antioxidant enzyme activities and total antioxidant capacity of serum and breast muscle were found in the supplemented birds. The breast meat of the supplemented birds had lower (P {\textless} 0.05) carbonyl and malondialdehyde contents, and higher (P {\textless} 0.05) water holding capacity and redness compared with the non-supplemented meat. 5. These results illustrated that supplementation with either 5 g/kg SAL or 5 g/kg SBL attenuated the deleterious effects of heat stress in broiler chickens.},

The experiment was conducted upon 1600 male Ross 308, each aged 1 day, broiler strains with an average body weight of 43.15 +/- 1.35 g were randomly allotted into four dietary treatment groups where CON, basal diet; TRT1, CON + 0.05\% FO; TRT2, CON + 0.10\% FO; and TRT3, CON + 0.15\% FO respectively. Each treatment group consisted of 20 replication pens, with each pen containing 20 broiler chicks. The 4-week long experiment was divided into two phases. The first phase (Days 7-21), the second phase (Days 22-35) and the overall (Days 7-35). On Day 21, the body weight of broilers in TRT2 and TRT3 was higher than the control. Increasing doses of purified FO supplementation showed a linear (p {\textless} 0.05) increase in body weight on Day 21. At the end of Phase 1, FO supplementation improved the body weight gain (BWG) of TRT2 and TRT3 group birds compared to CON. Increasing doses of FO supplementation increased the BWG linearly in all phases. Increasing doses of FO increased chicks' breast muscle weight with the highest value in the TRT3 group. Moreover, liver weight was linearly decreased in FO supplementation groups compared to the CON group. Abdominal fat was linearly decreased in FO supplemented groups. FO supplementation caused the lowest cholesterol and triglyceride in TRT3 than the CON group with a linear reduction. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced by FO supplemental groups. In addition, FO supplementation increased the red blood cell (RBC) in the TRT3 group compared to the CON group. In conclusion, refined FO increased BWG, breast muscle weight and RBC and reduced cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL in broilers' blood.},

	abstract = {Life-history traits of eels display a high level of phenotypic plasticity in response to large-scale biogeographical drivers, as well as local conditions encountered during the continental phase. Here, we provided a biogeographical snapshot of the variability of life-history traits of eels (Anguilla anguilla), across a large proportion of their natural distribution range. Silver eels (n = 99) were collected across eleven European catchments to investigate how life-history traits vary along geographical and saline habitats, as it was inferred from the Sr:Ca ratio in otoliths. Among 13 life-history traits tested, 3 of them such as total length, body or liver weight were related to geographical coordinates. Overall, eels grow faster in southern Europe and migrate earlier suggesting that the silvering process is related to the local growth conditions more than fish age. The salinity profiles revealed by the otoliths' Sr:Ca ratios indicate that eels with a brackish life-history generally grow faster, reach larger size-at-age, and have a better condition than eels living in freshwater. This observation associated with the lower abundance of the sanguivorous swimbladder nematode, Anguillicola crassus, confirms the importance of brackish areas for sustaining the eel production. A large proportion of the observed variation of life-history traits remained unexplained by the biogeographical trends and salinity condition, which suggests that other drivers act at the catchment scale.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate growth performance, carcass yield, intestinal morphology, organ development, nutrient digestibility, and blood biochemical parameters of broiler fed 1\% reduced-protein diets with/without protease supplementation. A total of 1,120 one-day-old male broiler chickens with average initial body weight (BW), 46.45 +/- 0.49 g, were divided into five groups with seven replications and 32 birds per replication. The treatment varied according to the protein and protease enzyme levels: positive control (PC), negative control (NC, PC with reduction of 1\% protein), PC supplemented with 50 g/t protease (PC + 50), NC supplemented with 50 g/t protease (NC + 50), and NC supplemented with 100 g/t protease (NC + 100). The results showed that there was no significant effect of 1\% reduced-protein diets, with or without protease on feed intake, final BW, average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, and nutrient digestibility. The changes in dietary protein level and supplementation of protease did not affect carcass yield, but significantly affected abdominal fat content, PC + 50 group had significantly lower abdominal fat content than NC-based diet including NC, NC + 50, NC + 100. Reduced-protein with protease supplementation strongly affected organ weight, especially on day 21: the pancreas was heavier in PC and NC + 50 group than other groups, spleen was heaver in NC group than in NC + 100 group, thymus was heavier in NC + 50 group than in PC, NC and NC + 100 group, small intestine was heavier in NC + 50 and NC + 100 group than in PC group, and large intestine was also heavier in NC + 50 group than in NC group. Villus height sampled at 35-d was significantly increased with protease supplement, and which was significantly higher in NC + 100 group than NC group. Regarding on blood metabolites, only urea and uric acid were affected by the reduction of dietary protein, broiler fed PC diet had higher urea and uric acid content than fed NC diet. In conclusion, supplementation of 50 g/t protease in 1\% reduced-protein diets does not negatively affect on growth, nutrient digestibility, carcass yield, organ development, and blood metabolites. Moreover, supplementation of protease in low-protein diet could effectively promote organ development and benefit intestine morphology.},

The experiment was conducted on chicks fed with basal diet (CON), commercial mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS), crude oligosaccharide extract from CMM, and crude oligosaccharide extract from ST. The experimental diets were supplemented with 2 and 1 g/kg oligosaccharides during the starter and grower periods, respectively.Results: The body weight gain (BWG) of birds in the MOS group was higher than that of birds in the other groups (p{\textless}0.05) in the starter period. However, during the grower period, ST significantly improved the BWG compared to the MOS (p{\textless}0.05). MOS, CMM, and ST showed no influence on the carcass and visceral organ weight and the weight and length of intestine (p{\textgreater}0.05). The digestibility of gross energy was greater (p{\textless}0.05) in the CMM group than in the CON group during the grower period. Morphological changes were absent in the dietary treatments (p{\textgreater}0.05).Conclusion: The improvements in the growth performance were partly driven by nutrient digestibility of such oligosaccharides having prebiotic properties. This result can indicate that supplementing broiler diets with crude oligosaccharides from CMM and ST had no negative effect on the growth performance and gut development of broilers.},

	abstract = {BackgroundFollowing the prohibition of in-feed antibiotics, poultry nutritionists are increasingly interested in the use of functional feed. Unripe banana flour (UBF) contains significant amounts of oligosaccharides (which may act as prebiotics) and antioxidants, making it a potential functional feed for broilers. However, research on the use of UBF as a functional feed ingredient for broilers is limited. ObjectivesThe study investigated the effect of UBF with or without probiotic and multienzyme on growth, internal organ weight and carcass characteristics of broilers. MethodsA total of 392 broiler chicks were distributed into 4 groups included CONT (chicks receiving control feed), UBF (chicks receiving 5\% UBF in feed), UBFPRO (5\% UBF plus 0.05\% probiotics) and UBFZYM (5\% UBF plus 0.05\% multienzyme). Data on growth performance were weekly recorded, whereas data on internal organs and carcass were collected on day 38. ResultsFeed conversion ratio (FCR) was lower (p {\textless} 0.05) in UBF, UBFPRO and UBFZYM than that in CONT chicks, with no significant difference in body weight, body weight gain and feed intake. There was a tendency that gizzard was higher (p = 0.08) in CONT than in UBF chicks. Also, pancreas tended (p = 0.09) to be lower in UBFZYM than in CONT birds. There was a notable effect (p {\textless} 0.05) of dietary treatments on the yellowness (b*) values of thigh meats, in which UBFPRO had lower b* values than that of CONT but did not differ from that of UBF and UBFZYM. There was no difference (p {\textless} 0.05) in carcass and commercial proportion of broilers. ConclusionsFeeding of 5\% UBF with or without probiotic and multienzyme improved FCR, without negatively affecting the carcass characteristics of broilers.},

Birds were fed with either 1 of the 3 dietary treatments: 1) corn-soy-bean meal-based diet (CON), 2) CON + 3\% microalgae (MAG), and 3) MAG + xylanase (MAG+XYN) in 2 phases (starter: d 0-21 and finisher: d 22-35) in mash form. Each dietary treatment had 6 replicates, with 9 birds in each replicate. The level of significance was con-sidered at the P value {\textless}0.05. The BW, ADG, and ADFI were significantly higher in MAG by 50\%, 52.5\%, and 42.4\%, respectively, and MAG+XYN by 44.1\%, 49.7\%, and 38.6\%, respectively, compared to the CON group. No significant difference was observed for FCR; however, FCR was reduced by 6.3\% in both MAG and MAG +XYN groups compared to the CON group. The carcass and organ weight relative to the total body weight were not significantly different among the treatments. The expressions of Zonula occludens 1 (ZO1), Cluster of dif-ferentiation 56 (CD56), and Solute carrier family 7 member 7 (SLC7A7) were significantly modulated, for example, by 3.7, 3.9, and 3.3 folds, respectively, in the MAG group compared to CON and 0.8, 0.6, and 1.1 folds, respectively, in the MAG group compared to MAG +XYN groups on d 35. Villi surface area (VSA) of ileum tended to increase on d 3 (P = 0.0725) and d 35 (P = 0.0785) in the MAG and MAG+XYN groups, com-pared to the CON group. The results suggest that adding microalgae with or without xylanase to broiler's diet could promote growth performance and show a tendency to improve gut health parameters. The nutrient profile and its functional properties make microalgae a valuable resource to the poultry industry as a part substitution of corn and soybean meal and a functional feed supplement to modulate the gut health of broilers.},

Before the arrival of chicks, the brooders, chick feeders, drinkers, humidity, temperature, and feeding management were controlled according to scientific patterns. These birds were randomly divided into seven groups and six replications of eight birds, viz. Group-A (positive control on basal diet only), Group-B (negative control on basal diet and HS), group-C (basal diet + simple Se 0.3 mg/kg feed), Group-D (basal diet + SeNP 0.3 mg/kg feed + HS), Group-E (BD + HS + chitosan), Group-F (BD + Se + COS), and Group-G (nano Se with chitosan 0.3 mg/kg + BD + HS). On the 42(nd) day of research, two birds were selected from each replication and sacrificed after blood collection. The initial data related to feeding intake, live body weight, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were collected before slaughter. The intestinal samples were collected and immediately transferred to formalin after grass morphometry. The live body weight, FCR, feed intake, intestinal histomorphology, relative organ weight, and antioxidant parameters like MDA, SOD, and GPX were significant (P {\textgreater} 0.005) in all groups, with Group-G at the highest, followed by Groups-F, E, D, C, A, and B. Group-B (negative control group) was the most affected group in all aspects because of heat stress and only basal diet. It was concluded that heat stress highly causes a loss in performance, intestinal gross morphology, and histology in poultry, and increases stress conditions, whereas the selenium nanoparticle works to improve the body weight, FCR, and intestinal parameters.},

	abstract = {This experiment was conducted to explore the effect of long-term supplementation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3 (25-OHD) as a vitamin D-3 (VD3) substitute on performance, bone traits, and egg quality of laying hens from 1 day to 72 weeks of age. In total, 900 one-day-old Lohman pullets were randomly allotted into three dietary groups (three treatments x 15 replicates x 20 birds per replicate): VD3 2800 IU/kg; 25-OHD 69 mu g/kg; 25-OHD 125 mu g/kg. At the end of the 20th w, five replicates from each group were selected to feed on the same vitamin D diets, as used during the rearing stage (1-20 w) until 72 w. The result showed that the 25-OHD 125 mu g/kg treatment had the lowest average daily feed intake (ADFI) at 1-8 or 1-19 w, body weight at 8 w, body weight gain between 1 and 8 w and shank length at 4 w (p {\textless} 0.05). The 25-OHD 125 mu g/kg treatment had a lower shank length at 7 w, compared with the 25-OHD 69 mu g/kg treatment. The shank length of the birds in each treatment reached the maximum (about 103 mm) at about 18 w of age. For the bone traits, the 25-OHD 125 mu g/kg treatment had the lowest femur bone diameter at 20 w (p {\textless} 0.001) and femur bone plumpness at 20 w (p = 0.002). The 25-OHD 125 mu g/kg treatment had a lower tibia strength at 10 w (p = 0.023) and keel length at 10 w (p = 0.046), compared with the 25-OHD 69 mu g/kg treatment. However, both 25-OHD 69 and 125 mu g/kg treatments had a greater femur strength at 72 w (p = 0.006), compared with the VD3 2800 IU/kg treatment. No difference in laying performance was observed among all treatments. The overall (21-72 w) ADFI in the 25-OHD 125 mu g/kg treatment was significantly lower than that in the 25-OHD 69 mu g/kg treatment (p = 0.030). At 60 w, the 25-OHD 125 mu g/kg treatment had a lower eggshell thickness (p = 0.012) and proportion of eggshell (p = 0.022), compared with the 25-OHD 69 mu g/kg treatment. No significant differences in egg quality parameters were observed at 50 and 70 w among treatments. In general, supplementary 2800 IU/kg doses of VD3 at the early stage were sufficient to maintain the bone quality and growth and development of pullets. Feeding birds at a higher 25-OHD level (125 mu g/kg) resulted in the reduced ADFI and growth at the rearing period, but the long-term supplementation of 25-OHD as a VD3 substitute improved the bone quality in the late laying period.},

Non -enzyme-fed (no-ENZ: n = 1,575) and enzyme-fed (ENZ: n = 1,575) day-old male Cobb500 broilers were placed in floor pens (45 chicks/pen) and allocated to five corn -soy-bean meal-based diets: a basal diet supplemented with either bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD, 55 mg/ kg), 0.5 or 1\% of CRP or LBP in a 2 pound 5 factorial design for 35-day experiment. Body weight (BW), feed intake (FI) and mortality were recorded whereas BW gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calcu-lated. Birds were sampled at days 21 and 35 for organ weights and plasma metabolites. There were no interac-tions between diet and ENZ on any parameter (P {\textgreater} 0.05) and no effect of ENZ on overall (d 0-35) growth performance and organ weights (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Birds fed BMD were heavier (P {\textless} 0.05) at d 35 and had better overall FCR than berry-supplemented birds. Birds fed 1\% LBP had poor FCR than birds fed 0.5\% CRP. Birds fed LBP exhibited heavier liver (P {\textless} 0.05) than birds fed BMD or 1\% CRP. The highest plasma concentrations of aspartate transaminase (AST), creatine kinase (CK) at d 28 and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) at d 35 were found in ENZ-fed birds (P {\textless} 0.05). At d 28, birds fed 0.5\% LBP showed higher plasma AST and CK con-centrations (P {\textless} 0.05). However, CRP feeding resulted in a lower plasma CK level compared with BMD feeding (P {\textless} 0.05). The lowest cholesterol level was detected in 1\% CRP-fed birds. In conclusion, this study showed no ENZ effects to potentiate berry pomaces on the overall growth performance of broilers (P {\textless} 0.05. However, plasma profiles revealed the potential of ENZ to modu-late the metabolism of pomace-fed broilers. LBP increased BW during the starter phase, while CRP increased BW during the grower phase.},

This study investigated its potential toxicity in non-human primates before human clinical trials. Daily KDS2010 doses (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) were orally administered to cynomolgus monkeys (1 animal/sex/group, 4 males and 4 females) for 2 weeks to determine the dose range. One male was moribund, and one female was found dead in the 100 mg/kg/day group. One male was also found dead in the 50 mg/kg/day group. The death was considered an adverse effect in both sexes since distal tubules/collecting duct dilation and hypertrophy in the epithelium of the papillary duct were observed in their kidneys. Based on dose range finding results, KDS2010 (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 4 weeks, and animals were given 2 weeks for recovery. No significant changes were observed during daily clinical observations and macro-and microscopic examinations, including body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry, and organ weight. And, the kidney was seen as the primary target organ of KDS2010 in the 2 weeks study, but no adverse effect was observed in the 4 weeks study. Therefore, 40 mg/kg/day is considered the no-observed-adverse-effect level in both sexes of cynomolgus monkeys.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The morphological features of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in mammals reflect a species' food niche breadth and dietary adaptations. For many wild mammals, the relationship between the structure of the GIT and diet is still poorly understood, for example, the GIT for frugivorous primates is usually classified as unspecialized and homogeneous. Here, we compare the GIT structure of 13 primate species from the three families of extant platyrrhines (Atelidae, Pitheciidae, and Cebidae) in Amazonia, and discuss possible evolutionary adaptations to different diets and trophic niches.Methods: We measured the length of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, cecum, colon, and rectum of the digestive tracts of 289 primate specimens. We determined the allometric relationships of the different tubular organs with the total length of the GIT as a proxy of specimen body size. Allometric parameters were used to establish the quotients of differentiation of every organ for each primate specimen.Results: There was a high differentiation in structure of the digestive organs among genera. Alouatta specimens clearly separated from the other genera based on dissimilarities in gastric, colonic, and rectal quotients, likely linked to the fermentation of plant contents. In contrast, all cebines (Sapajus, Cebus, and Saimiri) and Cacajao species had similar small intestine quotients, which is expected due to their high rates of animal matter consumed.Conclusions: We show that diverse adaptations in digestive structure exist among frugivorous primates, which in turn reflect different dietary patterns within this group that may enable the geographic coexistence of different primate species.},

	abstract = {Background: Black garlic, also known as fermented garlic, is a useful food that may have therapeutic benefits. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of fermented garlic and orlistat therapy on obese rats. Methods: A total of 40 male albino rats (245-250 g) were fed either an HFD (n = 32) or a normal diet (n = 8) for 6 weeks; therefore we randomly assigned the rats into: group I (normal diet), group II (HFD), groups III and IV (HFD with fermented garlic), and group V (orlistat for) 6 weeks. Two different dosages of fermented garlic (481.2 mg/kg and 963.3 mg/kg) were administered. Afterward, blood was collected, body weight was measured, and tissue was collected for further analysis. Results: Both the orlistat and black garlic groups showed a significant reduction in BMI, lipid profiles, and insulin levels compared with the baseline. The orlistat group showed significant elevation (p {\textless} 0.005) in body weight, organ weight, lipids, and liver parameters, with histopathological findings. The administration of black garlic improved the inflammatory markers with all other parameters. Conclusion: The fermented garlic and orlistat reinstated all of the investigated parameters significantly (p {\textless} 0.05), especially body weight and lipid profiles, and induced histopathological changes compared to the drug orlistat. Additionally, it showed anti-obesity-related therapeutic impacts compared with the orlistat drug. Black garlic provides a reliable and effective treatment for obesity compared to orlistat.},

We tested the hypotheses that (a) selective breeding for high voluntary exercise in mice would elevate both (V)over dot(O2,max) and BMR, and (b) these increases are accompanied by increases in the size of some internal organs (ventricle, triceps surae muscle, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, brain). We measured 72 females from generations 88 and 96 of an ongoing artificial selection experiment comprising four replicate High Runner (HR) lines bred for voluntary daily wheel-running distance and four non-selected control lines. With body mass as a covariate, HR lines as a group had significantly higher (V)over dot(O2,max) (+13.6\%, P{\textless}0.0001), consistent with previous studies, but BMR did not significantly differ between HR and control lines (+6.5\%, P=0.181). Additionally, HR mice did not statistically differ from control mice for whole-body lean or fat mass, or for the mass of any organ collected (with body mass as a covariate). Finally, mass-independent (V)over dot(O2,max) and BMR were uncorrelated (r=0.073, P=0.552) and the only statistically significant correlation with an organ mass was for (V)over dot(O2,max) and ventricle mass (r=0.285, P=0.015). Overall, our results indicate that selection for a behavioral trait can yield large changes in behavior without proportional modifications to underlying morphological or physiological traits.},

One hundred quail birds (7 days old) were divided into five groups (n = 20 for each group). Group 1: Control group received a normal protein diet (NPD) containing no oak flour (0\%). Groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 (experimental groups) received 5, 10, 15, and 20\% oak flour in NPD, respec-tively. The results showed no significant differences in mean body and organ weight between treated and control groups, but except for the concentration of 5\% showed significant increase in body weight over six weeks when compared with control. No significant differences were also recorded in the hemoglobin and packed cell volume in both treated and control groups. When compared to the control group, group 5 (20\%) had a significant increase in the number of heterophils cells and a significant decrease in the number of lymphocytes. While other types of leucocytes showed no significant changes in their numbers in all groups. Treatment with oak acorn flour showed no significant effects on levels of all biochemical parameters enrolled in this study in all groups. In conclusion: Quail feeds could contain 20\% oak acorn flour seemed to be save and without adverse effects on the body and organ weight, and all blood parameters. Oak acorns could be employed as a source of energy in a quail diet, and their nutritional value is equivalent to that of cereal grains.},

This short rearing time results in increasing interest among breeders and consumers. The aim of the study was a comparative analysis of two genotypes and sexes of Japanese and Pharaoh quails and their impact on body weight, carcass composition, meat quality, digestive system morphometry and leg bone dimensions. The study involved 40 birds (10 females and 10 males), Japanese quail and Pharaoh quail, 42 days old. Quail genotype had an effect (P {\textless} 0.05) on body weight, carcass weight, and some percentage of carcass elements. In addition, there was a significant effect of quail genotype on intramuscular fat and water content of pectoral and leg muscles. The origin of the quails interacted (P {\textless} 0.05) with the lightness (L*), yellowness (b*), cutting work, hardness, springiness, chewiness, gumminess, fibre cross-sectional area, vertical fibre diameter, and perimysium thickness of pectoral muscle. In addition, genotype was found to influence some anatomical traits, such as the percentage of proventriculus, heart, and liver on body weight, lengths and diameters of duodenum, caeca, and colon, and most dimensions of leg bones (femur and tibia). The sex of the birds significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) affected body weight, carcass weight, percentage of skin with subcutaneous fat in the carcass, as well as water content, lightness (L*), and springiness, most microstructure characteristics of pectoralis muscle, and also water and protein contents, and yellowness (b*) of leg muscles. In addition, differences were found between males and females (P {\textless} 0.05) in terms of duodenum and caeca diameter, length of greatest and medial femur, and greatest length of tibia. It can be stated that in terms of body weight and carcass weight as well as some meat quality features (protein content, fat content, fiber cross-sectional area), the pharaoh quail was the better genotype, while in terms of the proportion of muscles in the carcass and selected meat quality features: hardness, gumminess, chewiness, Japanese quails turned out to be better.},

	abstract = {Some drugs or chemicals exhibit different safety profiles in newborns/young children compared to adults. Polyhexamethyleneguanidine phosphate (PHMG-P) has been implicated in the humidifier disinfectant tragedy in 2011. There are limited reports on the toxicity of PHMG-P in neonatal animals. This study aimed to assess the toxicity of PHMG-P in neonates and to compare toxicity between young and adult mice. Mice aged 7-10 days and 8 weeks were anesthetized with isoflurane and then intranasally instilled with 0.9 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg PHMG-P once weekly for 4 weeks. The control group was given a corresponding volume of saline intranasally. Approximately 20 h after the 4th instillation, all mice (juveniles aged 28-31 days and adults aged 11 weeks) were euthanized. Assessments included body weights, organ weights, cytokine production, and histopathological examinations. Both juvenile and adult mice exhibited significant pulmonary toxicity. There were no significant changes in body weight in either male or female juveniles, whereas adult mice experienced 5.0-22.2\% weight loss. However, lung weights increased in both age groups, accompanied by rises in cytokines and chemokines. Histopathological analyses revealed significant lung changes in both juvenile and adult mice, including immune cell infiltration, foamy macrophage, and granulomatous inflammation. PHMG-P is known to cause inflammation and fibrotic changes in rodents and humans that persist even during long recovery periods. Further research is required to explore the long-term health effects of PHMG-P following repeated early-life exposure.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine the nutritional value of black soldier fly (BSF) larvae meal for quail (experiment I) and the dose-response effects of BSF levels on growth performance, relative organ weight, and body composition of growing quails (experiment II). In experiment I, 100 35-day-old quail were distributed in a completely randomized design, with two treatments (reference and test diet) and 10 replicates. The experimental period consisted of 5 days of adaptation, followed by 5 days of total excreta collection. The experimental feed consisted of a reference diet and a test diet formulated with 850 g/kg reference diet and 150 g/kg BSF. In experiment II, 1000 1-day-old quail were distributed in a completely randomized design, with five dietary levels of BSF (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 g/kg). At 42 days of age, birds were slaughtered, and the relative organ weight and body composition were determined. Apparent metabolizable energy values corrected for nitrogen retention of BSF meal were 13.8 MJ/kg. Across the starter (1-14 days) and overall period (1-42 days), increasing BSF levels had a quadratic effect on body weight and body weight gain. Feed conversion ratio was quadratically affected during the starter phase and linearly reduced over the overall period. Additionally, the BSF levels linearly decreased the small intestine's relative weight at 42 days and had a quadratic effect on the rate of protein deposition. We concluded that the inclusion of 100 g/kg BSF meal improves feed conversion ratio for growing quail.},

	doi = {10.1139/as-2024-0010},
	abstract = {Temporal variation in resource availability, physiological demands, and other factors are associated with many phenotypic changes in organisms. For example, there are often predictable stages of atrophy and hypertrophy in animals' organs to accommodate changes in diet. Timing of stages may differ by sex given differences in life histories (e.g., egg-laying versus male-male competition). In this context, we quantified changes over the annual cycle in 153 long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis) carcasses. We also tested whether timing of changes differed by sex. Total body mass was lowest in February and highest in November, whereas livers, spleens, kidneys, and salt glands were lightest in the middle of breeding seasons. Reductions in kidney and salt gland masses coincided with switches to using freshwater from marine habitats. Generally, timing in patterns of body mass change did not differ by sex. This was unexpected, and could arise from the compressed breeding season. We were also interested in evaluating whether changes in masses of tissues or organs were more dramatic for a species that breeds at such high latitudes than for species that breed at lower latitudes, but were unable to glean this information from the literature. We present coefficients of variation to facilitate future comparisons.},

	abstract = {The hindlimbs of Accipitriformes are vital for capturing prey. Research on hindlimb musculature has primarily focused on species preferring avian and mammalian prey, whereas piscivorous species have received limited attention. This study aims to investigate the quantitative characteristics of hindlimb muscles in two piscivorous Accipitriformes, Pandion haliaetus and Haliaeetus albicilla, to discern potential muscular features associated with their specific food preference. The mass and proportion of all hindlimb muscles in both species were assessed based on their primary function (flexion or extension). A Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to analyze possible differences in muscle mass between species. The allometric relationships between the muscles and body mass were explored with the reduced major axis method. Additionally, a study on the architectural parameters of the primary gripping muscles in P. haliaetus was conducted, using published information from other raptorial birds for comparison. The isometric scaling relationship predominated in the majority of individual muscles helping maintain a proportional relationship relative to body mass. Both species exhibited a similar pattern in terms of quantitative muscle features, implying a preservation of muscle characteristics linked to their predatory capabilities. The largest proportion of hindlimb muscle mass was dedicated to digit flexion in accordance with the grasping abilities of birds of prey. The muscles tibialis cranialis, flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus exhibited the greatest mass, high physiological cross-sectional area values, and long fibre, categorizing them as high-power specialists. These muscles are crucial in the flexion movements that produce the gripping action that characterizes birds of prey. Although no statistically significant differences were detected, each species displayed slightly distinct muscular characteristics, particularly in the architectural properties of the flexor muscles controlling digits II, III, and IV. These variations seem to be associated with differences in their prey preferences. The hindlimb musculature of Pandion haliaetus and Haliaeetus albicilla showed remarkable similarities, indicating a strong preservation of muscle traits essential for their raptorial abilities. Specifically, the flexor muscles -, flexor hallucis longus, tibialis cranialis, and flexor digitorum longus exhibited distinct architectural designs in both species, characterized by high PCSA (physiological cross sectional area) values and elongated fibers, crucial for gripping actions. However, the muscles responsible for controlling digits II, III, and IV displayed intermediate values for both fiber length and PCSA, but with variations observed between species, likely linked to differences in prey preferences. image},
